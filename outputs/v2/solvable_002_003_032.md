## Question

What is the internal energy of a gas that undergoes a process where it expands from a volume of 2 L to 6 L, and has a work done on it of 500 J, assuming the gas does not transfer heat to or from its surroundings? The gas has a constant pressure of 5 atm and there are no changes in its chemical composition.

## True Answer

To find the change in internal energy of the gas, we can use the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (∆U) is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):

∆U = Q - W

Since the gas does not transfer heat to or from its surroundings, Q = 0. Therefore, the equation becomes:

∆U = -W

We are given that the work done on the gas is 500 J. However, since the work is done on the gas, the work done by the system is negative:

W = -500 J

Now we can find the change in internal energy:

∆U = -(-500 J)
∆U = 500 J

The internal energy of the gas increases by 500 J during the process.

## Model Responses

### anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5

I'll solve this step-by-step using the first law of thermodynamics.

## Given Information

- Initial volume: $V_i = 2$ L
- Final volume: $V_f = 6$ L
- Work done **on** the gas: $W_{on} = 500$ J
- Heat transfer: $Q = 0$ (adiabatic process - no heat transfer)
- Pressure: $P = 5$ atm (constant)

## Step 1: Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics

The first law of thermodynamics states:

$$\Delta U = Q - W_{by}$$

where:

- $\Delta U$ = change in internal energy
- $Q$ = heat added to the system
- $W_{by}$ = work done **by** the gas

Alternatively, using work done **on** the gas:

$$\Delta U = Q + W_{on}$$

## Step 2: Identify the Given Values

Since the gas does not transfer heat with its surroundings:
$$Q = 0$$

We're told work done **on** the gas is $W_{on} = 500$ J.

## Step 3: Calculate Change in Internal Energy

Substituting into the first law:

$$\Delta U = 0 + 500 \text{ J} = 500 \text{ J}$$

## Step 4: Verify with Work Calculation

Let me verify this makes sense by calculating the work done **by** the gas during expansion:

$$W_{by} = P \Delta V = P(V_f - V_i)$$

Converting pressure to SI units:
$$P = 5 \text{ atm} \times 101,325 \text{ Pa/atm} = 506,625 \text{ Pa}$$

Converting volumes to SI units:
$$\Delta V = (6 - 2) \text{ L} = 4 \text{ L} = 4 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3$$

$$W_{by} = 506,625 \times 4 \times 10^{-3} = 2,026.5 \text{ J}$$

**Important Note:** There's an inconsistency in the problem statement. The gas **expands** (volume increases), so it does positive work on its surroundings. The work done **by** the gas should be approximately 2,027 J, meaning work done **on** the gas should be approximately -2,027 J, not +500 J.

## Final Answer

**Based on the given data as stated:**

$$\boxed{\Delta U = 500 \text{ J}}$$

The internal energy of the gas **increases** by 500 J.

However, I must note that this problem contains a physical inconsistency: an expanding gas at constant pressure typically does positive work on its surroundings (negative work done on it), yet we're told positive work is done on it. In a realistic adiabatic expansion at constant pressure, the internal energy would **decrease** by approximately 2,027 J.

Of course. Let's break down this problem step-by-step. This is a classic thermodynamics problem that hinges on a careful application of the First Law of Thermodynamics.

### Guiding Principle: The First Law of Thermodynamics

The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy for a thermodynamic system. It states that the change in the internal energy of a system (`ΔU`) is equal to the heat (`Q`) added to the system minus the work (`W`) done _by_ the system on its surroundings.

The formula is:

`ΔU = Q - W`

Where:

- `ΔU` is the change in the system's internal energy. This is what we want to find.
- `Q` is the net heat transferred _into_ the system. `Q > 0` for heat added, `Q < 0` for heat removed.
- `W` is the net work done _by_ the system on its surroundings. `W > 0` when the system expands, `W < 0` when the system is compressed.

It is crucial to be careful with the sign convention for work. Some textbooks define `W` as the work done _on_ the system. In this solution, we will use the standard convention where `W` is work done _by_ the system.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information

Let's carefully parse the information provided in the question:

- **Initial Volume (`V₁`)**: 2 L
- **Final Volume (`V₂`)**: 6 L
- **Work done _on_ the gas**: 500 J. Let's call this `W_on`.
- **Heat Transfer (`Q`)**: The gas "does not transfer heat to or from its surroundings." This means the process is **adiabatic**. Therefore, `Q = 0`.
- **Pressure (`P`)**: Constant at 5 atm. (We will address this information later).

Our goal is to find the change in the internal energy, `ΔU`.

#### Step 2: Relate the Given Work to the First Law's Convention

The problem states that the work done _on_ the gas is 500 J.
`W_on = 500 J`

The First Law of Thermodynamics, `ΔU = Q - W`, uses `W` as the work done _by_ the gas. The work done _by_ the gas is the negative of the work done _on_ the gas.

`W = -W_on`

Therefore, the work done _by_ the gas in this process is:

`W = - (500 J) = -500 J`

A negative value for `W` means the surroundings did work on the gas, which is consistent with the problem statement.

#### Step 3: Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics

Now we have all the necessary components to apply the First Law:

`ΔU = Q - W`

Substitute the values we've identified:

- `Q = 0` (since the process is adiabatic)
- `W = -500 J`

`ΔU = 0 - (-500 J)`

`ΔU = 500 J`

The change in the internal energy of the gas is **500 J**. Since the value is positive, the internal energy of the gas has increased.

### An Important Clarification on the Provided Data

You might have noticed that the problem provides pressure and volume information (P = 5 atm, V₁ = 2 L, V₂ = 6 L) in addition to the work done. An expert would immediately check for consistency. Let's see what happens if we calculate the work done during a constant-pressure (isobaric) expansion.

The work done _by_ a gas expanding at constant pressure is given by:
`W_calc = P * ΔV = P * (V₂ - V₁)`

First, we must convert the units to SI units (Pascals for pressure, cubic meters for volume) to get work in Joules.

1.  **Pressure Conversion:**
    `1 atm = 101,325 Pa`
    `P = 5 atm * 101,325 Pa/atm = 506,625 Pa`

2.  **Volume Conversion:**
    `1 L = 0.001 m³`
    `ΔV = V₂ - V₁ = 6 L - 2 L = 4 L`
    `ΔV = 4 L * 0.001 m³/L = 0.004 m³`

3.  **Calculate Work:**
    `W_calc = P * ΔV = (506,625 Pa) * (0.004 m³) = 2026.5 J`

This calculation shows that a gas expanding from 2 L to 6 L against a constant external pressure of 5 atm would do `+2026.5 J` of work _on its surroundings_.

**This creates a contradiction.** The problem explicitly states that the work done _on_ the gas was 500 J (meaning work done _by_ the gas was `-500 J`), while the pressure and volume data suggest the work done _by_ the gas should be `+2026.5 J`.

**How to resolve this?** In physics problems, you must use the explicit values given for the fundamental quantities of an equation. The First Law directly relates `ΔU`, `Q`, and `W`. The problem provides explicit values for `Q` (it's zero) and `W` (it's `-500 J`). The pressure and volume information must be considered extraneous or descriptive of a more complex process than a simple isobaric expansion. For instance, the stated pressure of 5 atm might be the internal pressure of the gas, while other forces were also doing work, leading to the net work of `-500 J`.

Therefore, the correct approach is to use the directly supplied values for heat and work.

### Final Answer

The change in the internal energy of the gas is determined by the First Law of Thermodynamics, `ΔU = Q - W`.

Given:

- Heat transferred, `Q = 0` (adiabatic process).
- Work done _on_ the gas is `500 J`, which means the work done _by_ the gas is `W = -500 J`.

Substituting these values into the First Law:

`ΔU = 0 - (-500 J)`
`ΔU = 500 J`

**The change in the internal energy of the gas is +500 J.**

### openai/gpt-5

Key principle (first law of thermodynamics):

- Using the sign convention where work done on the system is positive,
  ΔU = Q + W_on.

Given:

- No heat exchange (adiabatic): Q = 0.
- Work done on the gas: W_on = +500 J.

Therefore:

- ΔU = 0 + 500 J = +500 J.

So, the change in internal energy of the gas is +500 J.

Note on the provided pressure/volume data:

- For a constant-pressure expansion from 2 L to 6 L at 5 atm, the pressure–volume work done by the gas would be W_by = P ΔV = 5 atm × 4 L = 20 L·atm ≈ 2.03 kJ (positive by the gas), which corresponds to W_on = −2.03 kJ.
- This conflicts with “work done on it of 500 J” unless additional non-PV work is involved. If the intent was that the net work on the gas is +500 J (and Q = 0), then ΔU = +500 J as computed above. If instead only PV work is present with Q = 0, then ΔU = −2.03 kJ.
