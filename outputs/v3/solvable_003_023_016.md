## Question
A 20 meter long wire carries a current of 5 A. Calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the wire.

## True Answer
To calculate the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the wire, we can use Ampere's Law, which is given by the formula:

B = (μ₀ * I) / (2 * π * r)

where B is the magnetic field, μ₀ is the permeability of free space (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A), I is the current, and r is the distance from the wire.

Given:
I = 5 A (current)
r = 15 cm = 0.15 m (distance from the wire)

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

B = (4π × 10^-7 Tm/A * 5 A) / (2 * π * 0.15 m)

B = (20π × 10^-7 T) / (0.3 m)

B = (20/0.3) × 10^-7 T

B ≈ 6.67 × 10^-6 T

So, the magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the wire is approximately 6.67 × 10^-6 Tesla.

# Magnetic Field from a Current-Carrying Wire

## Initial Principles

For a long, straight current-carrying wire, the magnetic field at a perpendicular distance from the wire is given by **Ampère's Law**. For an infinitely long wire, the formula is:

$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$$

where:
- $B$ = magnetic field strength (in Tesla)
- $\mu_0$ = permeability of free space = $4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ T·m/A
- $I$ = current (in Amperes)
- $r$ = perpendicular distance from the wire (in meters)

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Identify Given Values

- Length of wire: $L = 20$ m
- Current: $I = 5$ A
- Distance from wire: $r = 15$ cm $= 0.15$ m

### Step 2: Check Validity of Infinite Wire Approximation

The formula above assumes an infinitely long wire. For a finite wire, we need to verify if this approximation is valid.

**Rule of thumb:** If the observation point is much closer to the wire than the wire's length ($r \ll L$), the infinite wire approximation is acceptable.

In our case:
- $r = 0.15$ m
- $L = 20$ m
- Ratio: $r/L = 0.15/20 = 0.0075 \ll 1$

Since the distance is much smaller than the wire length, **the infinite wire approximation is valid**.

### Step 3: Apply the Formula

Substituting the values into the magnetic field equation:

$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$$

$$B = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 5}{2\pi \times 0.15}$$

### Step 4: Simplify

Notice that $\pi$ cancels:

$$B = \frac{4 \times 10^{-7} \times 5}{2 \times 0.15}$$

$$B = \frac{20 \times 10^{-7}}{0.30}$$

$$B = \frac{2 \times 10^{-6}}{0.30}$$

$$B = 6.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ T}$$

### Step 5: Express in Standard Units

$$B = 6.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ T} = 6.67 \text{ μT}$$

## Final Answer

The magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the wire is:

$$\boxed{B = 6.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ T} \text{ or } 6.67 \text{ μT}}$$

**Direction:** The magnetic field forms concentric circles around the wire, with the direction given by the **right-hand rule** (thumb points in current direction, fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field).

### google/gemini-2.5-pro
Of course. Let's break down this problem step-by-step. This is a classic problem in electromagnetism, a cornerstone of physics that describes the interplay between electricity and magnetism.

### Overview

The fundamental principle we'll use is that an electric current (which is just moving electric charges) produces a magnetic field in the space around it. The geometry and strength of this field depend on the shape of the wire and the amount of current it carries. For a long, straight wire, the solution is particularly elegant and can be found using **Ampere's Law**.

### Step 1: State the Governing Principle and Formula

Ampere's Law relates the magnetic field integrated around a closed loop to the electric current passing through that loop. For a long, straight wire, the magnetic field lines form perfect circles centered on the wire. By applying Ampere's Law to such a circular loop, we derive a simplified formula for the magnitude of the magnetic field ($B$) at a perpendicular distance ($r$) from the wire:

$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}$

Let's define the terms in this crucial equation:

*   $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field, measured in Teslas (T).
*   $I$ is the current flowing through the wire, measured in Amperes (A).
*   $r$ is the radial distance from the center of the wire to the point where we are measuring the field, measured in meters (m).
*   $\mu_0$ is a fundamental constant of nature called the **permeability of free space** (or the magnetic constant). It represents the ability of a vacuum to support the formation of a magnetic field. Its value is exactly defined as $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}\cdot\text{m/A}$.

### Step 2: Address the "Long Wire" Approximation

The formula above is technically for an *infinitely* long wire. Your problem specifies a wire of 20 meters. Is this a valid approximation?

Let's check. The approximation is valid when the distance from the wire ($r$) is much, much smaller than the length of the wire ($L$). In our case:

*   Distance $r = 15 \text{ cm} = 0.15 \text{ m}$
*   Length $L = 20 \text{ m}$

Since $0.15 \text{ m} \ll 20 \text{ m}$, the point of measurement is very close to the wire relative to its total length. From this point, the ends of the wire are very far away, and their contribution to the magnetic field is negligible. Therefore, we can confidently model the 20-meter wire as an infinitely long wire for this calculation.

### Step 3: List Knowns and Convert to SI Units

It is critical in physics to work with a consistent set of units. The standard is the International System of Units (SI).

*   Current, $I = 5 \text{ A}$ (This is already in SI units).
*   Distance, $r = 15 \text{ cm}$. We must convert this to meters:
    $r = 15 \text{ cm} \times \frac{1 \text{ m}}{100 \text{ cm}} = 0.15 \text{ m}$
*   Permeability of free space, $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}\cdot\text{m/A}$

### Step 4: Substitute and Calculate

Now we substitute these values into our formula from Step 1.

$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}$

$B = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}\cdot\text{m/A}) \times (5 \text{ A})}{2 \pi \times (0.15 \text{ m})}$

We can simplify the expression by canceling the $\pi$ and dividing 4 by 2:

$B = \frac{2 \times 10^{-7} \times 5}{0.15} \text{ T}$

$B = \frac{10 \times 10^{-7}}{0.15} \text{ T}$

$B = \frac{1 \times 10^{-6}}{0.15} \text{ T}$

Now, we perform the final division:

$B \approx 6.666... \times 10^{-6} \text{ T}$

Rounding to three significant figures, we get:

$B \approx 6.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ T}$

This can also be expressed in microteslas ($\mu$T), where $1 \mu\text{T} = 10^{-6} \text{ T}$:

$B \approx 6.67 \ \mu\text{T}$

### Direction of the Field

While the question only asks for the magnitude, it's good practice to consider the direction. The direction of the magnetic field is given by the **Right-Hand Rule**. If you point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the current, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines. This means the field forms concentric circles around the wire.

### Final Answer

The magnetic field at a distance of 15 cm from the 20-meter long wire carrying a current of 5 A is:

$B = 6.67 \times 10^{-6} \text{ T}$
(or $6.67$ microteslas, $\mu$T)

For context, this is a relatively weak magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field, for example, is typically in the range of 30-60 $\mu$T.

### openai/gpt-5
Principle:
The magnetic field around a long straight current-carrying wire at a perpendicular distance r is, from the Biot–Savart law,
B = μ₀ I / (2π r)
This is exact for an infinitely long wire. For a finite straight wire of length L observed at the midpoint, the exact result is
B = (μ₀ I / 2π r) sin α, with sin α = (L/2) / √[(L/2)² + r²]

Given:
- I = 5 A
- r = 15 cm = 0.15 m
- L = 20 m (so L/2 = 10 m)
- μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A

1) Infinite-wire approximation (justified since L ≫ r):
B ≈ μ₀ I / (2π r) = (4π × 10⁻⁷) × 5 / (2π × 0.15)
= (2 × 10⁻⁷) × 5 / 0.15
= 1.0 × 10⁻⁶ / 0.15
≈ 6.67 × 10⁻⁶ T = 6.67 μT

2) Finite-length correction at the midpoint:
sin α = (10) / √(10² + 0.15²) = 10 / √(100 + 0.0225) ≈ 10 / 10.001125 ≈ 0.999887
B = (μ₀ I / 2π r) sin α ≈ (6.67 μT) × 0.999887 ≈ 6.66 μT

Final answer:
B ≈ 6.7 μT (circulating around the wire according to the right-hand rule).
