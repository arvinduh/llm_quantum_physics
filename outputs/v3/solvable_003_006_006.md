## Question
What is the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular coil with a radius of 10 cm and carrying a current of 2 A? Given that the coil has 50 turns and the magnetic permeability of free space is 4π x 10^-7 Tm/A.

## True Answer
To calculate the magnetic field strength at the center of a circular coil, we can use the formula:

B = (μ₀ * N * I) / (2 * R)

where B is the magnetic field strength, μ₀ is the magnetic permeability of free space, N is the number of turns in the coil, I is the current, and R is the radius of the coil.

Given values:
μ₀ = 4π x 10^-7 Tm/A
N = 50 turns
I = 2 A
R = 10 cm = 0.1 m (converting to meters)

Now, we can plug these values into the formula:

B = (4π x 10^-7 Tm/A * 50 * 2 A) / (2 * 0.1 m)

B = (4π x 10^-7 * 100) / 0.2

B = (4π x 10^-5) / 0.2

B = 2π x 10^-4 T

The magnetic field strength at the center of the circular coil is 2π x 10^-4 T (tesla).

# Magnetic Field at the Center of a Circular Coil

## Initial Principles

The magnetic field at the center of a circular coil is given by the **Biot-Savart Law**. For a circular loop carrying current, this simplifies to:

For a **single turn**: 
$$B_{\text{single}} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2R}$$

For **N turns** (multiple loops):
$$B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{2R}$$

Where:
- `B` = magnetic field strength (Tesla, T)
- `μ₀` = magnetic permeability of free space = `4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A`
- `N` = number of turns
- `I` = current (Amperes, A)
- `R` = radius of the coil (meters, m)

## Given Information

- Radius: `R = 10 cm = 0.10 m`
- Current: `I = 2 A`
- Number of turns: `N = 50`
- Permeability of free space: `μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A`

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Identify the appropriate formula
Since we have multiple turns, we use:
$$B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{2R}$$

### Step 2: Substitute the values
$$B = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 50 \times 2}{2 \times 0.10}$$

### Step 3: Simplify the calculation
$$B = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 100}{0.20}$$

$$B = \frac{400\pi \times 10^{-7}}{0.20}$$

$$B = 2000\pi \times 10^{-7}$$

$$B = 2 \times 10^{-4} \times \pi$$

### Step 4: Calculate the numerical value
$$B = 2\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$$

$$B \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$$

$$B \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$$

Or in milliTesla:
$$B \approx 0.63 \text{ mT}$$

## Final Answer

The magnetic field strength at the center of the circular coil is:

$$\boxed{B = 2\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T} \text{ or } 0.63 \text{ mT}}$$

This result makes physical sense: the magnetic field increases with more turns and higher current, and decreases with larger radius. The field strength of ~0.6 mT is reasonable for a coil with these parameters.

### openai/gpt-5
We use the magnetic field at the center of a circular coil with N turns:
\[ B = \frac{\mu_0 N I}{2R} \]

Where:
- \( \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\ \text{T·m/A} \)
- \( N = 50 \)
- \( I = 2\ \text{A} \)
- \( R = 10\ \text{cm} = 0.10\ \text{m} \)

Substitute:
\[
B = \frac{(4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 50 \times 2}{2 \times 0.10}
= \frac{4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 100}{0.20}
= \frac{4\pi \times 10^{-5}}{0.20}
= 20\pi \times 10^{-5}
= 2\pi \times 10^{-4}\ \text{T}
\]

Numerically,
\[
B \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{T} = 0.628\ \text{mT}.
\]

Final answer: \( B \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-4}\ \text{T} \) (about 0.628 mT) at the center of the coil.

Of course. Let's break down this problem step-by-step to find the magnetic field strength at the center of the circular coil.

### 1. Fundamental Principle: Biot-Savart Law

The magnetic field generated by a current-carrying wire is described by the Biot-Savart Law. For a simple circular loop of wire, this law can be integrated to yield a straightforward formula for the magnetic field at its exact center.

The magnetic field `B` at the center of a single circular loop is given by:
$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2R}$

Where:
*   $B$ is the magnetic field strength.
*   $\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space.
*   $I$ is the current flowing through the wire.
*   $R$ is the radius of the loop.

Since our coil has multiple turns, and each turn contributes to the magnetic field at the center, we can find the total magnetic field by simply multiplying the field from a single loop by the number of turns, $N$.

Therefore, the formula we will use is:
$B = \frac{N \mu_0 I}{2R}$

### 2. Identify the Given Information

Let's list the values provided in the problem:

*   **Number of turns (N):** 50
*   **Radius of the coil (R):** 10 cm
*   **Current (I):** 2 A
*   **Magnetic permeability of free space ($\mu_0$):** $4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ Tm/A

### 3. Unit Conversion

Before we plug the values into our formula, we must ensure all units are in the standard SI system. The radius is given in centimeters (cm), which needs to be converted to meters (m).

*   **Radius (R):**
    $R = 10 \text{ cm} = 10 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m} = 0.1 \text{ m}$

### 4. Step-by-Step Calculation

Now we can substitute our known values into the formula for the magnetic field of a multi-turn coil.

**Formula:**
$B = \frac{N \mu_0 I}{2R}$

**Substitute the values:**
$B = \frac{(50) \cdot (4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ Tm/A}) \cdot (2 \text{ A})}{2 \cdot (0.1 \text{ m})}$

**Simplify the expression:**
First, let's calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.

*   **Numerator:**
    $N \mu_0 I = 50 \times (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 2 = 100 \times 4\pi \times 10^{-7} = 400\pi \times 10^{-7}$ T·m

*   **Denominator:**
    $2R = 2 \times 0.1 = 0.2$ m

**Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:**
$B = \frac{400\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T·m}}{0.2 \text{ m}}$

$B = \frac{400}{0.2} \times \pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}$

$B = 2000 \times \pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}$

To make this number easier to read, we can express it in scientific notation:
$B = 2\pi \times 10^3 \times 10^{-7} \text{ T}$
$B = 2\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$

Finally, let's calculate the numerical value using $\pi \approx 3.14159$:
$B \approx 2 \times 3.14159 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$
$B \approx 6.283 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$

This can also be expressed in millitesla (mT) or microtesla (µT):
*   $B \approx 0.6283$ mT
*   $B \approx 628.3$ µT

### Final Answer

The magnetic field strength at the center of the circular coil is:
$B = 2\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T} \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$
