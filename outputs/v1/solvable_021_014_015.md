## Question

What is the observed relationship between the size of a black hole and the luminosity of its associated quasar?

## True Answer

The observed relationship between the size (mass) of a black hole and the luminosity of its associated quasar is known as the Eddington luminosity. In general, the larger the mass of the black hole, the higher the luminosity of the quasar. This is because the gravitational force of the black hole attracts more matter from its surroundings, which then forms an accretion disk around the black hole. As the matter in the accretion disk spirals inwards, it gets heated up due to friction and releases energy in the form of light, making the quasar shine brightly.

The Eddington luminosity is the maximum luminosity a black hole can achieve when the radiation pressure outward balances the gravitational force pulling matter inwards. This balance prevents the black hole from accreting matter at a faster rate. The Eddington luminosity is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole, with the relationship given by:

L_Edd = 4πGMm_p\*c/σ_T

where L_Edd is the Eddington luminosity, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, m_p is the proton mass, c is the speed of light, and σ_T is the Thomson scattering cross-section for an electron.

In summary, the observed relationship between the size of a black hole and the luminosity of its associated quasar is that larger black holes generally have more luminous quasars, with the maximum luminosity limited by the Eddington luminosity.

# Relationship Between Black Hole Size and Quasar Luminosity

## Initial Principles

The relationship between black hole mass and quasar luminosity is governed by **accretion physics** and the **Eddington limit**. Let me work through this step-by-step.

## Step 1: The Eddington Luminosity

The maximum luminosity a black hole can sustain while accreting matter is the **Eddington luminosity**, where radiation pressure balances gravitational attraction:

$$L_{\text{Edd}} = \frac{4\pi G M c}{\kappa}$$

where:

- $G$ = gravitational constant
- $M$ = black hole mass
- $c$ = speed of light
- $\kappa$ = opacity (for Thomson scattering, $\kappa \approx 0.34$ cm²/g)

This simplifies to:

$$L_{\text{Edd}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{38} \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right) \text{ erg/s}$$

## Step 2: Quasar Luminosity Relation

Quasars typically radiate at some fraction of the Eddington limit:

$$L_{\text{quasar}} = \epsilon L_{\text{Edd}}$$

where $\epsilon$ is the Eddington ratio (typically 0.1 to 1 for bright quasars).

## Step 3: The Observed Relationship

Since $L_{\text{Edd}} \propto M$, we get:

$$\boxed{L_{\text{quasar}} \propto M_{\text{BH}}}$$

**This is a direct, linear relationship.**

## Observed Characteristics:

1. **More massive black holes → More luminous quasars**

   - Supermassive black holes ($10^8 - 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) power the brightest quasars
   - Luminosities can reach $L \sim 10^{47}$ erg/s or more

2. **Empirical Evidence:**

   - The $M_{\text{BH}} - L$ correlation is observed across quasar populations
   - Reverberation mapping confirms this relationship
   - The $M_{\text{BH}} - \sigma$ relation (black hole mass vs. velocity dispersion) provides independent confirmation

3. **Scatter in the Relationship:**
   - Not all black holes accrete at the same Eddington ratio
   - Accretion rate and efficiency introduce scatter
   - Some massive black holes may be "dormant" with low luminosity

## Final Answer

**The observed relationship is a positive, approximately linear correlation:** more massive black holes are associated with more luminous quasars, following $L \propto M_{\text{BH}}$, constrained by the Eddington limit. The brightest quasars in the universe are powered by the most massive supermassive black holes ($\sim 10^9 - 10^{10} M_{\odot}$).

Key principles

- Quasar power comes from accretion: \(L \simeq \eta\,\dot{M}c^{2}\), with radiative efficiency \(\eta \sim 0.06\!-\!0.3\).
- Radiation pressure limits the steady luminosity to the Eddington value:
  \[
  L*{\rm Edd} \;=\; \frac{4\pi G M m*{p} c}{\sigma*{T}}
  \;\approx\; 1.26\times 10^{38}\,\left(\frac{M}{M*\odot}\right)\;{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}.
  \]
- The Schwarzschild radius (a proxy for black hole “size”) scales with mass:
  \[
  R\_{S} = \frac{2GM}{c^{2}} \propto M.
  \]

Observed relationship

- Quasar luminosities are typically a fixed fraction of the Eddington limit,
  \[
  \lambda*{\rm Edd} \equiv \frac{L*{\rm bol}}{L\_{\rm Edd}} \sim 0.1\text{–}1,
  \]
  across broad samples.
- Therefore,
  \[
  L*{\rm bol} \;\approx\; \lambda*{\rm Edd}\,L\_{\rm Edd} \;\propto\; M,
  \]
  i.e., more massive (larger) black holes host more luminous quasars, with an approximately linear scaling in log–log space and scatter set by the Eddington ratio and accretion physics.

Stated succinctly: the luminosity of a quasar increases roughly in direct proportion to the size (mass) of its central black hole, with an upper bound given by the Eddington luminosity \(L\_{\rm Edd}\propto M\).

### google/gemini-2.5-pro

Excellent question. The relationship between the "size" of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the luminosity of its associated quasar is one of the foundational pillars of modern extragalactic astrophysics. Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of this connection.

### Summary of the Relationship

The observed relationship is a **strong, positive correlation**: more massive black holes power more luminous quasars. This is not just an empirical finding but is rooted in a fundamental physical limit known as the **Eddington Luminosity**. In essence, a black hole's mass sets an upper limit on how brightly its accretion disk can sustainably shine.

### Step-by-Step Derivation and Explanation

#### Step 1: Defining the Key Players

1.  **Black Hole "Size"**: The most physically relevant measure of a black hole's size is its **mass**, denoted as $M_{BH}$. While the event horizon's radius (Schwarzschild radius, $R_S = 2GM_{BH}/c^2$) is also a measure of size, the mass is the fundamental property that determines the gravitational field.
2.  **Quasar Luminosity ($L_{QSO}$)**: A quasar is an extremely luminous Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Its luminosity is not produced by the black hole itself, but by the **accretion disk** of gas and dust that swirls around it. As matter in the disk spirals inward, it heats up to extreme temperatures due to viscous forces and friction, releasing enormous amounts of energy as electromagnetic radiation across the spectrum. $L_{QSO}$ is the total power radiated by this disk.

#### Step 2: The Physical Principle - The Eddington Limit

The core of the relationship lies in the balance between two opposing forces acting on the accreting gas:

- **Inward Force**: The immense **gravitational force** of the black hole, pulling matter inward.
- **Outward Force**: The intense **radiation pressure** from the hot accretion disk, pushing matter outward.

For accretion to be stable, gravity must be able to overcome radiation pressure. The **Eddington Luminosity ($L_{Edd}$)** is the maximum luminosity an object of a given mass can achieve while maintaining this balance (hydrostatic equilibrium). If the luminosity were to exceed this limit, the radiation pressure would blow away the accreting gas, effectively shutting off the fuel supply and dimming the quasar.

#### Step 3: Derivation of the Eddington Luminosity

Let's derive this limit by equating the gravitational force and the radiation pressure force on a particle of gas (for simplicity, a proton) at a distance $r$ from the central black hole.

1.  **Gravitational Force ($F_{grav}$)**:
    The force of gravity on a proton of mass $m_p$ from a black hole of mass $M_{BH}$ is given by Newton's law of gravitation:
    $F_{grav} = \frac{G M_{BH} m_p}{r^2}$

2.  **Radiation Pressure Force ($F_{rad}$)**:
    The outward force is due to photons scattering off electrons in the ionized plasma (the protons are dragged along by the electrostatic attraction to the electrons). The most relevant process is Thomson scattering. The force on a single electron is the rate of momentum transfer from the radiation field.
    The energy flux from the central source at distance $r$ is $S = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2}$.
    The force is this flux times the interaction cross-section ($\sigma_T$, the Thomson cross-section) divided by the speed of light ($c$):
    $F_{rad} = \frac{S \sigma_T}{c} = \frac{L \sigma_T}{4\pi r^2 c}$

    _Note: We use the proton's mass ($m_p$) for gravity because it contains most of the mass of a hydrogen atom, but the electron's cross-section ($\sigma_T$) for radiation pressure because it interacts much more strongly with photons._

3.  **Equating the Forces**:
    The Eddington limit, $L_{Edd}$, is found by setting $F_{grav} = F_{rad}$:
    $\frac{G M_{BH} m_p}{r^2} = \frac{L_{Edd} \sigma_T}{4\pi r^2 c}$

    A crucial point is that the $r^2$ terms cancel out. This means the Eddington limit is independent of the distance from the black hole.

4.  **Solving for $L_{Edd}$**:
    Rearranging the equation to solve for the luminosity gives the Eddington Luminosity:
    $L_{Edd} = \frac{4\pi G c m_p}{\sigma_T} M_{BH}$

#### Step 4: Stating the Relationship and Plugging in Constants

The derivation in Step 3 clearly shows a **direct linear proportionality** between the maximum luminosity and the black hole's mass:

$L_{Edd} \propto M_{BH}$

The term $\frac{4\pi G c m_p}{\sigma_T}$ is a constant. We can calculate its value:

- $G \approx 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \text{ m}^3 \text{ kg}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-2}$
- $c \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m s}^{-1}$
- $m_p \approx 1.672 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}$
- $\sigma_T \approx 6.652 \times 10^{-29} \text{ m}^2$

Plugging these in gives:
$L_{Edd} \approx (1.26 \times 10^{31} \text{ W/kg}) \times M_{BH}$

This is more conveniently expressed in terms of solar masses ($M_{\odot} \approx 1.989 \times 10^{30}$ kg) and solar luminosities ($L_{\odot} \approx 3.828 \times 10^{26}$ W):

$L_{Edd} \approx (1.26 \times 10^{31}) \times M_{BH} \frac{M_{\odot}}{1.989 \times 10^{30}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{31} \left(\frac{M_{BH}}{M_{\odot}}\right) \text{ W}$

$L_{Edd} \approx 3.3 \times 10^4 \left(\frac{M_{BH}}{M_{\odot}}\right) L_{\odot}$

This equation definitively demonstrates that a black hole that is twice as massive can be twice as luminous.

#### Step 5: Connecting Theory to Observation

The question asks for the _observed_ relationship. While $L_{Edd}$ is a theoretical maximum, observations show that most luminous quasars shine at a significant fraction of this limit.

We define the **Eddington Ratio**, $\lambda_{Edd}$:
$\lambda_{Edd} = \frac{L_{QSO}}{L_{Edd}}$

Observations of large quasar populations find that:

- Few quasars are observed with $\lambda_{Edd} > 1$ (super-Eddington accretion, which is thought to be possible but unstable and brief).
- The most luminous quasars tend to have Eddington ratios clustering in the range $\lambda_{Edd} \approx 0.1 - 1.0$.

Therefore, the observed luminosity of a quasar can be written as:
$L_{QSO} = \lambda_{Edd} \times L_{Edd} = \lambda_{Edd} \left(\frac{4\pi G c m_p}{\sigma_T}\right) M_{BH}$

Since $\lambda_{Edd}$ is typically found within a relatively narrow range for bright quasars, the observed luminosity $L_{QSO}$ maintains a strong, near-linear correlation with the black hole mass $M_{BH}$.

**Example:**
Consider a typical quasar powered by a $10^8 M_{\odot}$ black hole.
Its Eddington Luminosity would be:
$L_{Edd} \approx (3.3 \times 10^4) \times (10^8) L_{\odot} = 3.3 \times 10^{12} L_{\odot}$
This is equivalent to the light of over three trillion Suns.

If this quasar is observed to be shining at an Eddington ratio of $\lambda_{Edd} = 0.1$ (a typical value), its actual luminosity would be:
$L_{QSO} = 0.1 \times L_{Edd} = 3.3 \times 10^{11} L_{\odot}$

---

### Final Answer

The observed relationship between the size (mass) of a black hole and the luminosity of its associated quasar is a **strong, direct, and nearly linear correlation**. More massive black holes are capable of powering more luminous quasars.

This relationship is physically governed by the **Eddington Luminosity ($L_{Edd}$)**, which represents the maximum sustainable luminosity for a given black hole mass, determined by the balance between the inward pull of gravity and the outward push of radiation pressure. The relationship is mathematically expressed as:

$L_{Edd} = \frac{4\pi G c m_p}{\sigma_T} M_{BH} \propto M_{BH}$

While quasars do not all shine exactly at this limit, their observed luminosities ($L_{QSO}$) are typically a significant fraction of it (from 10% to 100%). This makes the observed quasar luminosity a reliable proxy for the mass of its central supermassive black hole.
