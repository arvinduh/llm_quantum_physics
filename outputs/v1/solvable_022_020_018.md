## Question

What evidence do we have that points towards the possibility of dark matter being composed of supersymmetric particles? Discuss the experimental methods being used for detecting such particles and explain their limitations.

## True Answer

The possibility that dark matter could be composed of supersymmetric particles arises from the theoretical framework of supersymmetry (SUSY). Supersymmetry is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics that predicts a partner particle for each known particle, with the partners differing by half a unit of spin. This theory helps address some of the limitations and unanswered questions in the Standard Model, such as the hierarchy problem and the unification of forces.

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence pointing towards dark matter being composed of supersymmetric particles is the existence of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact weakly with ordinary matter and have a mass in the range of 10 to 1000 times the mass of a proton. Supersymmetric particles, such as the neutralino, are predicted to have similar properties to WIMPs, making them a prime candidate for dark matter.

Several experimental methods are being used to detect supersymmetric particles, including:

1. Direct detection experiments: These experiments aim to detect the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei in a detector. Examples of direct detection experiments include the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS), the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment, and the XENON1T experiment. The limitation of these experiments is that they rely on the assumption that dark matter particles interact with ordinary matter, which may not be the case for all supersymmetric particles.

2. Indirect detection experiments: These experiments search for the products of dark matter particle annihilation or decay in cosmic rays, gamma rays, or neutrinos. Examples of indirect detection experiments include the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The limitation of these experiments is that they rely on the assumption that dark matter particles annihilate or decay into detectable particles, which may not be the case for all supersymmetric particles.

3. Collider experiments: These experiments aim to produce supersymmetric particles in high-energy collisions at particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The limitation of collider experiments is that they may not have enough energy to produce the heavier supersymmetric particles, and the production rates of these particles may be too low to be detected.

Despite these experimental efforts, no definitive evidence for supersymmetric particles has been found so far. The limitations of these experiments, along with the vast range of possible supersymmetric particle properties, make the search for dark matter composed of supersymmetric particles a challenging task. However, ongoing and future experiments, such as the LHC upgrades and next-generation direct detection experiments, will continue to probe the parameter space of supersymmetry and may eventually provide evidence for the existence of these elusive particles.

Of course. Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step solution to the question regarding supersymmetric dark matter.

---

### Introduction

The existence of dark matter is one of the most significant pieces of evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. It is inferred from its gravitational effects on galaxies and galaxy clusters, but it does not interact with light, making it invisible to all forms of electromagnetic radiation. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a theoretical extension of the Standard Model that proposes a fundamental symmetry between the two basic classes of elementary particles: bosons and fermions. For every Standard Model fermion (like an electron or quark), SUSY postulates a corresponding bosonic "superpartner" (a selectron or squark), and for every Standard Model boson (like a photon or gluon), it postulates a fermionic superpartner (a photino or gluino).

While not originally conceived to solve the dark matter problem, certain well-motivated SUSY models naturally provide an excellent dark matter candidate.

### Part 1: Evidence and Theoretical Motivation for Supersymmetric Dark Matter

The "evidence" for supersymmetric dark matter is not direct observational proof but rather a collection of strong theoretical arguments that make it a compelling hypothesis. The primary candidate is the **neutralino** ($\chi_1^0$), which is the lightest of the four neutral supersymmetric fermionic particles predicted in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).

The arguments in its favor are as follows:

#### 1. The WIMP Miracle

The term **WIMP** stands for **W**eakly **I**nteracting **M**assive **P**article. A WIMP is a generic class of particle that fits the requirements for a cold dark matter candidate. The "WIMP Miracle" refers to a remarkable coincidence:

- **Assumption:** Let's assume a new stable, massive particle ($\chi$) existed in thermal equilibrium with the primordial plasma of the early universe. As the universe expanded and cooled, the particle's density would decrease.
- **Freeze-Out:** annihilation reactions ($\chi + \chi \leftrightarrow \text{Standard Model particles}$) would keep the particle in equilibrium. However, as the universe expanded, the density of $\chi$ particles dropped to a point where they could no longer find each other to annihilate efficiently. At this point, their number density "froze out."
- **The Miracle:** If we calculate the relic abundance ($\Omega_\chi$) of a particle whose mass is in the range $100 \, \text{GeV} - 1 \, \text{TeV}$ and which interacts via the weak nuclear force, we find that its predicted abundance today is astonishingly close to the cosmologically observed dark matter abundance ($\Omega_{DM} \approx 0.27$).

The predicted relic abundance is approximately:
$ \Omega*\chi h^2 \approx \frac{3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{cm}^3/\text{s}}{\langle \sigma v \rangle} $
where $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ is the thermally averaged annihilation cross-section. A particle interacting via the weak force naturally has a $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ value that yields the correct $\Omega*\chi$. This is the "miracle": a particle with weak-scale interactions automatically gives the right amount of dark matter. The neutralino is a textbook example of such a particle.

#### 2. R-Parity and the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP)

For a particle to be a viable dark matter candidate, it must be stable or have a lifetime much longer than the age of the universe. Otherwise, it would have decayed away by now. Many supersymmetric theories introduce a new conserved quantum number called **R-parity**, defined as:
$ P_R = (-1)^{3(B-L) + 2s} $
where $B$ is the baryon number, $L$ is the lepton number, and $s$ is the spin.

- All Standard Model particles have $P_R = +1$.
- All their superpartners have $P_R = -1$.

If R-parity is conserved, it has two crucial consequences:

1.  Supersymmetric particles must be produced in pairs from the collision of ordinary particles.
2.  The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) must be absolutely stable, as there is no lighter state with $P_R = -1$ into which it can decay.

If this stable LSP is also electrically neutral and interacts only weakly (to avoid cosmological and observational constraints), it becomes a perfect dark matter candidate. In many plausible SUSY models, the **neutralino** is precisely this neutral, stable LSP.

#### 3. Mass and Interaction Properties

The neutralino is a quantum mechanical mixture of the superpartners of the neutral Standard Model bosons: the bino ($\tilde{B}$), the wino ($\tilde{W}^0$), and the two neutral Higgsinos ($\tilde{H}_1^0, \tilde{H}_2^0$).
$ \chi*1^0 = N*{11}\tilde{B} + N*{12}\tilde{W}^0 + N*{13}\tilde{H}_1^0 + N_{14}\tilde{H}_2^0 $
Its properties (mass, interaction cross-section) depend on the mixing coefficients $N_{ij}$. Theoretical models of SUSY predict the neutralino mass to be roughly in the WIMP range ($ \sim 100 \, \text{GeV} - \text{few TeV}$), aligning perfectly with the WIMP Miracle.

---

### Part 2: Experimental Detection Methods

The search for supersymmetric WIMPs like the neutralino follows a three-pronged approach:

#### 1. Direct Detection

- **Principle:** This method attempts to directly observe the collision of a dark matter particle from the galactic halo with an atomic nucleus in a highly sensitive detector deep underground. The expected signal is a tiny nuclear recoil, depositing a very small amount of energy (typically a few keV).
- **Methodology:**
  1.  **Detector:** Large vats of a target material, often a noble liquid like Xenon (e.g., XENONnT, LZ experiments) or Argon (e.g., DarkSide-20k), are used. These provide a large number of target nuclei.
  2.  **Signal:** A WIMP-nucleus collision would cause the nucleus to recoil, which then ionizes and scintillates the surrounding medium. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) or silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) detect the resulting faint flash of light and the ionization charge.
  3.  **Location:** Experiments are located deep underground (e.g., in mines or mountain tunnels) to shield them from cosmic rays, which would otherwise create an overwhelming background.
- **Expected Event Rate:** The rate $R$ is proportional to the local dark matter density $\rho_0$, the WIMP-nucleon interaction cross-section $\sigma_{\chi N}$, and inversely proportional to the WIMP mass $m_\chi$.
  $ R \propto \frac{\rho*0 \sigma*{\chi N}}{m\_\chi} $

#### 2. Indirect Detection

- **Principle:** This method searches for the products of dark matter annihilation or decay. If neutralinos are the dark matter, they should accumulate in regions of high density, such as the center of the Milky Way, the Sun, or dwarf galaxies. There, they can annihilate with each other.
  $ \chi + \chi \rightarrow \text{Standard Model Particles (e.g., } W^+W^-, b\bar{b}, \tau^+\tau^-) $
- **Methodology:** The annihilation products subsequently decay into stable, detectable particles like high-energy gamma rays, neutrinos, and antimatter (positrons, antiprotons).
  1.  **Gamma Rays:** Telescopes like the Fermi-LAT (space-based) and ground-based Cherenkov telescopes (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS) search for an excess of gamma rays from regions where dark matter is expected to be dense.
  2.  **Neutrinos:** Neutrino telescopes like IceCube at the South Pole look for high-energy neutrinos coming from the core of the Sun or the galactic center, where WIMPs may be trapped and annihilate.
  3.  **Antimatter:** Experiments like AMS-02 on the International Space Station search for an excess of positrons or antiprotons in cosmic rays, which could be a signature of dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo.

#### 3. Collider Production

- **Principle:** This method aims to produce supersymmetric particles, including neutralinos, directly in high-energy particle collisions.
- **Methodology:** At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), protons are collided at nearly the speed of light. If SUSY is real and its particles are within the energy reach of the LHC, the collisions could produce pairs of heavy superpartners (like squarks $\tilde{q}$ or gluinos $\tilde{g}$).
  $ p + p \rightarrow \tilde{g}\tilde{g}, \tilde{q}\tilde{q}, \dots $
    These heavy, unstable particles would rapidly decay through a cascade of other SUSY particles, ultimately ending with the stable LSPs (the neutralinos, $\chi_1^0$).
- **Signature:** Since neutralinos are weakly interacting, they would escape the detector without leaving a trace, just like neutrinos. Their presence is inferred by detecting a significant imbalance in the momentum of the visible decay products. This is known as **missing transverse energy** ($E_T^{\text{miss}}$). The classic signature is, therefore, energetic jets of particles, leptons, and large $E_T^{\text{miss}}$.

---

### Part 3: Limitations of Detection Methods

Despite extensive searches, no definitive signal for supersymmetric dark matter has been found. Each method faces significant challenges and limitations.

#### 1. Direct Detection Limitations

- **Extremely Low Cross-Sections:** Null results have pushed the upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross-section to incredibly small values. This means event rates are exceptionally low (less than one event per ton of target material per year for many models).
- **Backgrounds:** The primary challenge is distinguishing a true WIMP signal from background events. Sources include natural radioactivity in detector materials and the surrounding rock, as well as cosmic-ray-induced neutrons.
- **The Neutrino Floor:** The most fundamental limitation is the "neutrino floor" (or "neutrino fog"). Coherent scattering of neutrinos from the Sun, the atmosphere, and supernovae will produce nuclear recoils that are indistinguishable from a WIMP signal. Once experiments become sensitive enough to reach this floor, it will be nearly impossible to claim a discovery without novel background-rejection techniques. Current experiments are on the verge of reaching this floor for certain WIMP masses.

#### 2. Indirect Detection Limitations

- **Astrophysical Uncertainties:** Indirect detection signals are highly dependent on the distribution of dark matter, which is poorly known. The annihilation rate scales as the dark matter density squared ($ \propto \rho^2 $), so uncertainty in the density profile of the galactic center (e.g., "cuspy" vs. "cored") translates to a huge uncertainty in the expected signal.
- **Astrophysical Backgrounds:** The universe is full of sources that produce gamma rays, neutrinos, and antimatter. Pulsars, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei are all sources of high-energy particles. Disentangling a potential faint dark matter signal from these much brighter and poorly understood astrophysical foregrounds is a monumental task. The "Galactic Center Excess" seen by Fermi-LAT is a perfect example; it could be dark matter annihilation, but it could also be an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars.

#### 3. Collider Production Limitations

- **Energy Reach:** The LHC can only produce particles up to a certain mass. If the supersymmetric particles are heavier than the LHC's energy reach (roughly 1-2 TeV for strongly interacting superpartners), they will not be produced. The lack of a signal so far has already ruled out large portions of the "natural" SUSY parameter space.
- **Complex Model Space:** SUSY is not a single theory but a framework with over 100 free parameters in its most general form (the MSSM). Searches at the LHC must make simplifying assumptions to target specific scenarios. It is possible that SUSY exists in a "corner" of this vast parameter space that is difficult to probe, for example, in "compressed-spectrum" scenarios where the mass difference between superpartners is small, leading to soft, low-energy decay products that are hard to distinguish from background.
- **The "Lamppost Problem":** Searches are often focused on the simplest and most striking signatures. If nature has chosen a more subtle or complex manifestation of SUSY, current search strategies might be missing it.

### Conclusion

Supersymmetry provides one of the most elegant and well-motivated frameworks for explaining dark matter through the neutralino, a classic WIMP candidate whose existence is supported by the "WIMP Miracle" and the theoretical construct of R-parity. However, the powerful triad of direct detection, indirect detection, and collider searches has so far yielded null results. These results have placed severe constraints on the most straightforward and "natural" versions of supersymmetric models. While large regions of the SUSY parameter space remain unexplored, the lack of evidence has led the physics community to intensify its search for alternative dark matter candidates, such as axions or sterile neutrinos, while continuing to push the frontiers of the search for the supersymmetric WIMP.

# Evidence for Supersymmetric Dark Matter and Detection Methods

## I. Theoretical Motivation for Supersymmetric Dark Matter

### A. The WIMP Miracle

The most compelling theoretical evidence comes from the **"WIMP miracle"** – the remarkable coincidence that supersymmetric particles naturally produce the observed dark matter density.

The relic abundance of dark matter is determined by:

$$\Omega_{\chi} h^2 \approx \frac{3 \times 10^{-27} \text{ cm}^3\text{s}^{-1}}{\langle \sigma v \rangle}$$

where $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ is the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section.

For weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with mass $m_{\chi} \sim 100$ GeV - 1 TeV and coupling strength $\alpha \sim \alpha_{weak}$:

$$\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim \frac{\alpha^2}{m_{\chi}^2} \sim 3 \times 10^{-26} \text{ cm}^3\text{s}^{-1}$$

This yields $\Omega_{\chi} h^2 \sim 0.1$, matching observations ($\Omega_{DM} h^2 = 0.120 \pm 0.001$).

### B. R-Parity and Stable LSP

In supersymmetry with **R-parity conservation**:

$$R = (-1)^{3(B-L) + 2s}$$

where $B$ = baryon number, $L$ = lepton number, $s$ = spin.

- Standard Model particles: $R = +1$
- Supersymmetric particles: $R = -1$

This guarantees:

1. The **Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP)** is absolutely stable
2. LSP can only be produced/annihilate in pairs
3. LSP is electrically neutral (cosmologically required)

Leading candidates:

- **Neutralino** ($\tilde{\chi}^0_1$): mixture of bino, wino, and Higgsino
- **Gravitino** ($\tilde{G}$): in gauge-mediated SUSY breaking
- **Sneutrino** ($\tilde{\nu}$): largely excluded by direct detection

### C. Gauge Coupling Unification

Supersymmetry improves **gauge coupling unification**. The running couplings meet at:

$$M_{GUT} \sim 2 \times 10^{16} \text{ GeV}$$

with SUSY, versus poor unification without it. This suggests SUSY is part of nature's fundamental structure.

## II. Experimental Detection Methods

### A. Direct Detection Experiments

**Principle:** Detect nuclear recoils from elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering.

**Differential event rate:**

$$\frac{dR}{dE_R} = \frac{\rho_0}{m_{\chi} m_N} \sigma_0 \int_{v_{min}}^{v_{esc}} v f(v) F^2(E_R) dv$$

where:

- $\rho_0 \approx 0.3$ GeV/cm³ (local DM density)
- $E_R$ = nuclear recoil energy
- $F(E_R)$ = nuclear form factor
- $v_{min} = \sqrt{m_N E_R / (2\mu^2)}$ (minimum WIMP velocity)
- $\mu = m_{\chi}m_N/(m_{\chi} + m_N)$ (reduced mass)

**Major Experiments:**

1. **Xenon-based:** XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ)

   - Dual-phase time projection chambers
   - Current sensitivity: $\sigma_{SI} \sim 10^{-48}$ cm² (spin-independent)

2. **Germanium-based:** SuperCDMS, EDELWEISS

   - Cryogenic detectors at $\sim$ 50 mK
   - Excellent energy resolution

3. **Argon-based:** DarkSide-20k
   - Low radioactive backgrounds using underground argon

**Limitations:**

- **Neutrino floor:** Coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering creates irreducible background at $\sigma \sim 10^{-49}$ cm²

$$R_{\nu} = \frac{G_F^2}{4\pi} N^2 \rho_{\nu} E_R$$

- **Astrophysical uncertainties:** DM velocity distribution $f(v)$, local density $\rho_0$
- **Nuclear physics uncertainties:** Form factors, spin-dependent vs spin-independent cross-sections
- **No directional sensitivity** (mostly): cannot confirm galactic origin

### B. Indirect Detection Experiments

**Principle:** Detect products of WIMP annihilation in regions of high DM density.

**Annihilation rate:**

$$\Gamma \propto \langle \sigma v \rangle \int \rho^2(r) dV$$

**Major Experiments:**

1. **Gamma-rays:** Fermi-LAT, HESS, VERITAS

   Looking for monoenergetic lines: $E_{\gamma} = m_{\chi}$ (from $\chi\chi \to \gamma\gamma$)

   Or continuum from: $\chi\chi \to b\bar{b}, \tau^+\tau^-, W^+W^-$

2. **Antimatter:** AMS-02, PAMELA

   Positron fraction: $e^+/(e^+ + e^-)$ shows excess above 10 GeV

   However, likely explained by pulsars

3. **Neutrinos:** IceCube, ANTARES, KM3NeT

   From Sun/Earth capture: $\chi\chi \to \nu\bar{\nu}$

**Limitations:**

- **Astrophysical backgrounds dominant:** Pulsars, supernovae, cosmic ray interactions
- **Boost factor uncertainties:** DM substructure enhancement unclear
- **Model-dependent spectra:** Different annihilation channels produce different signals
- **Propagation uncertainties:** Diffusion, energy losses for charged particles

### C. Collider Searches (LHC)

**Principle:** Produce SUSY particles directly in proton-proton collisions.

**Search strategies:**

1. **Missing transverse energy ($E_T^{miss}$):**

$$E_T^{miss} = \left|\sum_i \vec{p}_{T,i}\right|$$

from escaping LSPs

2. **Signatures:**
   - Jets + $E_T^{miss}$ (squarks, gluinos)
   - Leptons + $E_T^{miss}$ (charginos, neutralinos)
   - Long-lived particles (if mass splitting is small)

**Current limits (13 TeV, Run 2):**

- Gluinos: $m_{\tilde{g}} > 2.3$ TeV
- First/second generation squarks: $m_{\tilde{q}} > 1.8$ TeV
- Winos: $m_{\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1} > 1.0$ TeV (depending on decay mode)

**Limitations:**

- **Compressed spectra:** Small mass splitting $\Delta m = m_{\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1} - m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_1} < 10$ GeV makes detection difficult
- **R-parity violation:** Would change signatures entirely
- **Luminosity limits:** Cannot probe arbitrarily high masses
- **Background challenges:** QCD multijet, $W/Z$ + jets processes
- **Model dependence:** Simplified models may not capture full SUSY parameter space

## III. Current Experimental Status

### Null Results and Tensions

Despite decades of searching:

1. **No direct detection** above background (XENON1T, LUX results)
2. **No conclusive indirect signals** (Galactic Center gamma-ray excess debated)
3. **No SUSY particles at LHC** up to TeV scale

This creates **"naturalness problem"**: Why is electroweak scale stable without low-mass SUSY?

### Fine-Tuning Parameter

$$\Delta = \frac{m_h^2}{\delta m_h^2}$$

where $\delta m_h^2$ are quantum corrections. Current limits suggest $\Delta > 100$ (1% tuning), considered "unnatural" by some.

## IV. Alternative Scenarios

Given null results, theorists explore:

1. **Split SUSY:** Scalars at ultra-high mass, gauginos accessible
2. **Stealth SUSY:** Compressed spectra, soft signatures
3. **Non-thermal production:** Avoiding WIMP miracle
4. **Axino/gravitino LSP:** Different detection strategies needed

## Conclusion

While supersymmetric dark matter remains theoretically attractive due to the WIMP miracle, gauge unification, and natural LSP candidate, experimental evidence remains elusive. The combination of increasingly sensitive direct detection (approaching neutrino floor), indirect searches (plagued by astrophysical backgrounds), and collider experiments (reaching energy limits) continues to constrain but not confirm the SUSY dark matter hypothesis. The field now explores both higher sensitivities in traditional channels and alternative SUSY scenarios that might evade current detection methods.

Summary of the logic

- Astrophysics tells us non-baryonic cold dark matter exists, but not what it is.
- Supersymmetry (SUSY) naturally provides a stable, electrically neutral, weakly interacting particle—the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP)—if R-parity is conserved. This LSP (often a neutralino) can have the right thermal relic density (“WIMP miracle”).
- There is no direct evidence for SUSY dark matter yet. What we have are (i) cosmological evidence for dark matter, and (ii) theoretical consistency checks that make a SUSY LSP a particularly well-motivated candidate.
- Three complementary experimental frontiers pursue such particles: direct detection, indirect detection, and collider production. All three have powerful but model-dependent sensitivities with important limitations; large regions of SUSY parameter space remain viable.

1. Why SUSY is a viable dark matter framework (circumstantial “evidence”)

- Observational evidence for DM (independent of SUSY): galaxy rotation curves, weak/strong lensing (e.g., Bullet Cluster), cosmic microwave background anisotropies, large-scale structure, and baryon acoustic oscillations—all consistent with cold, non-baryonic matter with density parameter Ω_DM ≈ 0.26.
- SUSY provides a stable DM candidate if R-parity is conserved. The lightest neutralino, χ̃⁰₁, is a mixture of bino (B̃), wino (W̃⁰), and higgsinos (H̃_u⁰, H̃_d⁰). Stability follows from R-parity: R = (−1)^{3B+L+2S}.
- The WIMP miracle: a thermal relic with weak-scale mass and interactions naturally freezes out with abundance close to the observed value. A standard estimate,
  - Freeze-out relic density:
    Ω*χ h^2 ≈ 0.12 × (3 × 10^{-26} cm^3 s^{-1}) / ⟨σ v⟩,
    suggests that a weak-scale cross section ⟨σ v⟩ ∼ 3 × 10^{-26} cm^3 s^{-1} gives the right Ω*χ.
    Neutralinos can realize this through different mechanisms:
  - Pure higgsino with m_χ ≈ 1 TeV (coannihilation within multiplet).
  - Pure wino with m_χ ≈ 2.5–3 TeV (Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation).
  - Mostly bino (which otherwise overcloses the universe) can work via coannihilation (with stau/stop/gluino), or resonant s-channel annihilation (“funnels”) via A/H or Z/h (2 m_χ ≈ m_A, m_h, m_Z), or “well-tempered” bino–higgsino/wino mixtures.
- Model coherence: SUSY addresses other high-energy questions (hierarchy problem, gauge coupling unification) and naturally yields a stable neutral particle—this coherently motivates SUSY dark matter even though it is not direct evidence for it.
- Important caveat: LHC has not found superpartners so far, pushing many simple (“natural”) SUSY spectra to higher masses. Still, viable neutralino DM regions remain (TeV-scale higgsinos/winos; bino with special mechanisms). Alternative SUSY DM (gravitino or axino) are also possible but much harder to detect directly.

2. How we try to detect SUSY dark matter and what limits us

A) Direct detection (nuclear and electron recoils in underground detectors)

- Principle: measure nuclear recoil energy E*R from elastic χ–nucleus scattering. The differential rate is
  dR/dE_R = (ρ_0 / (m*χ m*N)) ∫*{v>v_min(E_R)} f(⃗v) v (dσ/dE_R) d^3v,
  where ρ_0 ≈ 0.3–0.5 GeV cm^{-3} is the local DM density, f(⃗v) the halo velocity distribution, and dσ/dE_R the microscopic cross section.
- For neutralinos:
  - Spin-independent (SI) scattering (coherent, ∝ A^2) typically dominated by Higgs exchange; squark exchange is suppressed if squarks are heavy. The per-nucleon cross section scales roughly as
    σ*SI ∝ [ (g*{hχχ} f*N m_N) / m_h^2 ]^2,
    where g*{hχχ} depends on the bino–higgsino–wino admixture and f_N encodes nucleon scalar form factors.
  - Spin-dependent (SD) scattering arises from Z exchange (higgsino–wino content) and axial couplings to nucleon spins.
- Leading experiments and current reach (representative):
  - Liquid xenon TPCs (LUX/LZ, XENON1T/nT, PandaX): σ*SI sensitivity down to ∼10^{-47}–10^{-48} cm^2 near m*χ ∼ 30–50 GeV; weaker at high/low masses. Future multi-ton detectors (DARWIN/XLZD) target ∼10^{-49}–10^{-50} cm^2.
  - Liquid argon (DarkSide-20k, DEAP-3600) and cryogenic semiconductors (SuperCDMS, EDELWEISS) provide complementary mass/threshold coverage; Skipper-CCD and semiconductor targets (SENSEI, DAMIC-M, SuperCDMS-HV) probe sub-GeV χ via electron recoils.
  - SD-proton limits: PICO bubble chambers and solar neutrino searches (see below) are strongest, reaching σ*SD^p ≲ 10^{-41}–10^{-42} cm^2 depending on m*χ and annihilation channel.
- What parts of SUSY are probed:
  - “Well-tempered” bino–higgsino mixtures predict σ_SI ∼ 10^{-46}–10^{-45} cm^2 and are strongly constrained/excluded over wide mass ranges.
  - Nearly pure higgsino (m*χ ≈ 1 TeV) and wino (m*χ ≈ 2.5–3 TeV) have σ_SI ∼ 10^{-48}–10^{-49} cm^2 (or lower due to cancellations), approaching next-generation reach.
  - Pure bino with coannihilation/funnel annihilation often gives very small σ_SI and σ_SD, evading current experiments.
- Key limitations:
  - Neutrino floor: coherent scattering of solar, atmospheric, and diffuse supernova neutrinos produces an irreducible background. For SI searches this sets an effective floor around σ_SI ∼ 10^{-49}–10^{-48} cm^2 (mass dependent); surpassing it demands directional detection or new discriminants.
  - Astrophysical uncertainties: ρ_0, the local velocity distribution, and substructure alter rates by O(10–50)%, complicating precise interpretation.
  - Model “blind spots”: destructive interference among diagrams (e.g., signs of μ and M_1 in MSSM) can suppress σ_SI dramatically; pure states have suppressed couplings.
  - Low-mass sensitivity is limited by energy thresholds and quenching systematics; high-mass sensitivity falls due to 1/m_χ in the rate and kinematics.
  - Nuclear physics inputs (form factors, strange content f_s) introduce additional uncertainties at the ∼10–30% level in σ_SI mappings.

B) Indirect detection (annihilation or decay products in space)

- Principle: search for excesses in γ rays, e^±, p̄, and ν from χχ annihilation (or decay). The γ-ray flux from a region of the sky is
  dΦ*γ/dE = (⟨σ v⟩ / (8π m*χ^2)) ∑*f Br_f (dN*γ^f/dE) × J,
  where J = ∫\_{l.o.s} ρ^2(r) ds dΩ is the astrophysical J-factor.
- Key targets and current status:
  - Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S.): very clean backgrounds. Combined analyses set ⟨σ v⟩ ≲ few × 10^{-26} cm^3 s^{-1} for m_χ ≲ 100 GeV annihilating to b b̄, nearing or surpassing the canonical thermal value for some channels/masses.
  - Galactic center: bright but backgrounds are complex. The GeV excess could be due to unresolved pulsars or diffusion effects; a DM interpretation is debated and tightly constrained by other data.
  - γ-ray lines (χχ → γγ, γZ): smoking gun but loop-suppressed in SUSY. H.E.S.S./Fermi set strong limits; e.g., thermal wino around 2.5–3 TeV is under significant pressure from continuum and line searches, though details depend on halo profile and Sommerfeld effects.
  - Cosmic-ray antimatter (AMS-02 antiprotons/positrons): intriguing features are explainable by astrophysical sources/propagation; constraints on ⟨σ v⟩ are competitive but subject to large propagation and cross-section systematics.
  - CMB (Planck): s-wave annihilation during recombination injects energy constraining
    f*eff ⟨σ v⟩ / m*χ ≲ 4 × 10^{-28} cm^3 s^{-1} GeV^{-1},
    which excludes light (few–10 GeV) s-wave annihilators with thermal cross sections for many channels.
  - Neutrinos from the Sun (IceCube, Super-K, ANTARES): capture–annihilation equilibrium in the Sun gives
    Γ_A ≈ C/2, with C ∝ σ_SD^p,
    providing strong constraints on SD-proton scattering for χ annihilating to hard channels (e.g., W^+W^-).
- Key limitations:
  - Astrophysical systematics dominate: J-factor uncertainties (especially GC halo profile), cosmic-ray transport, source modeling, hadronic cross sections.
  - Particle-physics model dependence: final states, Sommerfeld enhancement, internal bremsstrahlung, coannihilation histories alter signals.
  - For heavy higgsino/wino, signals may lie near or below current instrument sensitivity; for bino-like χ, annihilation can be p-wave suppressed today.
  - Null results do not map uniquely to cross sections without halo and channel assumptions.

C) Collider searches (produce superpartners and infer invisible LSPs)

- Principle: produce SUSY states and infer missing transverse energy (MET) from escaping LSPs. Typical signatures: jets + MET, leptons + MET, photons + MET, monojet/monophoton, and long-lived charged/neutral tracks.
- Current status (indicative):
  - Strong production: gluinos m_ĝ ≳ 2.3–2.5 TeV and first/second-generation squarks m_q̃ ≳ 1.5–1.8 TeV in simplified R-parity-conserving models with large mass gaps.
  - Electroweakinos (χ̃⁰, χ̃^±) and sleptons: limits are weaker and highly spectrum-dependent; compressed spectra (Δm ≲ 10–20 GeV) are challenging and still allowed up to O(100 GeV–1 TeV).
  - No excess consistent with SUSY has appeared; many CMSSM-like scenarios are disfavored, but pMSSM parameter space remains open.
- Key limitations:
  - Model dependence: branching fractions, mass hierarchies, and compression strongly affect sensitivity; collider limits do not translate uniquely into DM properties.
  - Compressed spectra reduce MET and visible activity; long-lived particles require specialized searches.
  - LHC energy reach is limited for multi-TeV electroweakinos (e.g., 1–3 TeV higgsinos/winos), for which future colliders (HL-LHC, 100 TeV pp, or e^+e^− machines) would be decisive.

3. What remains viable for SUSY dark matter

- Neutralino DM:
  - Pure or nearly pure higgsino with m_χ ≈ 1 TeV: consistent with relic density; σ_SI near 10^{-48}–10^{-49} cm^2 (next-gen direct detection target); indirect signals small; collider reach challenging.
  - Pure or nearly pure wino with m_χ ≈ 2.5–3 TeV: tension with indirect γ-ray searches depends on halo assumptions; direct detection very difficult; colliders need >14 TeV energy to probe thoroughly.
  - Bino-like DM: viable via coannihilation (e.g., stau/stop/gluino) or A/H funnels; direct and indirect signals can be highly suppressed (“blind spots”), making discovery difficult.
- Non-neutralino SUSY DM:
  - Gravitino or axino (super-WIMPs): feeble couplings imply no conventional direct/indirect signal. Probes come from cosmology (BBN, CMB) and collider signatures of long-lived NLSPs (e.g., delayed decays).
  - Right-handed sneutrinos (in extended models): can be viable; signals mimic WIMPs but with altered couplings.

4. Bottom line and outlook

- Evidence “for SUSY dark matter” is theoretical and circumstantial: the thermal relic calculation naturally matches Ω_DM, R-parity ensures stability, and the neutralino’s properties fit astrophysical requirements. There is no direct experimental evidence yet for SUSY or SUSY dark matter.
- The three detection frontiers are highly complementary:
  - Direct detection is now excluding large swaths of “well-tempered” parameter space and will probe the canonical higgsino/wino territories down to and into the neutrino floor.
  - Indirect searches already exclude thermal annihilation for many channels below ∼100 GeV and increasingly constrain heavy winos; they are limited by astrophysical systematics.
  - Colliders have pushed colored superpartners to multi-TeV and are chipping away at electroweakinos; compressed and heavy spectra remain elusive.
- Limitations—neutrino backgrounds, astrophysical uncertainties, model blind spots, and collider kinematics—mean that SUSY dark matter can still hide. Progress will come from:
  - Next-generation detectors (DARWIN/XLZD, ARGO, DarkSide-20k, SuperCDMS, sub-GeV electron-recoil experiments).
  - γ-ray telescopes (CTA), improved CMB/21-cm energy-injection probes, and multi-messenger analyses.
  - HL-LHC and future colliders for electroweakinos and long-lived particles.

Final answer

- We have strong evidence that dark matter exists, but no direct evidence that it is supersymmetric. SUSY remains compelling because a stable, neutral, weak-scale LSP naturally yields the observed relic abundance via thermal freeze-out, Ω_χ h^2 ≈ 0.12 × (3 × 10^{-26} cm^3 s^{-1})/⟨σ v⟩, and has the right qualitative properties. This constitutes plausibility, not proof.
- Experimental searches target three avenues:
  1. Direct detection measures nuclear/electron recoils with rate dR/dE*R = (ρ_0/(m*χ m_N)) ∫ f(v) v (dσ/dE_R) d^3v. Current SI sensitivities reach ∼10^{-47}–10^{-48} cm^2; SD limits are ∼10^{-41}–10^{-42} cm^2. Limitations: neutrino floor, astrophysical/nuclear uncertainties, and SUSY “blind spots” or suppressed couplings.
  2. Indirect detection constrains ⟨σ v⟩ through γ rays, antimatter, and neutrinos via dΦ/dE ∝ ⟨σ v⟩ J / m_χ^2. Dwarf galaxies, the Galactic center, AMS-02, H.E.S.S./Fermi, Planck, and IceCube set strong but model-dependent bounds. Limitations: background modeling, J-factor and propagation uncertainties, p-wave or suppressed present-day annihilation.
  3. Colliders search for MET signatures from LSPs. Current limits push colored sparticles above ∼2 TeV; electroweakinos remain weakly constrained, especially for compressed spectra. Limitations: model dependence and kinematic reach.
- Viable SUSY dark matter remains in regions such as ∼1 TeV higgsinos, ∼3 TeV winos (subject to halo assumptions), and bino-like LSPs with coannihilation or funnel annihilation—scenarios that are challenging but accessible to the next generation of experiments.
