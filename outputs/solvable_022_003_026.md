## Question
"How does the distribution of dark matter affect the rotation curve of a galaxy, and what do the observations tell us about the amount and placement of dark matter in galaxies?"

## True Answer
The distribution of dark matter in a galaxy has a significant impact on its rotation curve, which is a plot of the orbital velocities of visible stars and gas in the galaxy as a function of their radial distance from the galactic center. The presence and distribution of dark matter can help explain the observed discrepancies between the expected rotation curves based on visible matter and the actual observed rotation curves.

According to Newtonian dynamics, the orbital velocity of stars and gas in a galaxy should decrease as their distance from the galactic center increases, similar to how planets in our solar system orbit the Sun. However, observations of spiral galaxies show that the rotation curves remain relatively flat or even slightly increase with distance from the center, indicating that there is more mass present than what is visible in the form of stars, gas, and dust.

This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of dark matter, a form of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect light and is thus invisible to telescopes. Dark matter is believed to make up approximately 85% of the total matter in the universe. Its gravitational influence on visible matter in galaxies causes the observed flat rotation curves.

The distribution of dark matter in a galaxy is typically modeled as a dark matter halo, which is an extended, roughly spherical distribution of dark matter surrounding the visible galactic disk. The density of dark matter in the halo decreases with increasing distance from the galactic center. This distribution of dark matter provides the additional gravitational force needed to explain the observed flat rotation curves.

Observations of the rotation curves of galaxies can provide valuable information about the amount and distribution of dark matter within them. By comparing the observed rotation curves with those predicted by various dark matter distribution models, astronomers can constrain the properties of dark matter halos, such as their mass, size, and density profile. This, in turn, helps improve our understanding of the nature and properties of dark matter and its role in the formation and evolution of galaxies.

# Dark Matter and Galactic Rotation Curves

## Initial Principles

The rotation curve of a galaxy describes the orbital velocity `v(r)` of stars and gas as a function of their distance `r` from the galactic center. This is governed by **Newtonian gravity** for non-relativistic systems:

```latex
v(r) = \sqrt{\frac{GM(r)}{r}}
```

where `M(r)` is the total mass enclosed within radius `r`.

## Step 1: Expected Rotation Curve (Visible Matter Only)

For a galaxy with mass distribution `ρ(r)`, the enclosed mass is:

```latex
M(r) = 4π \int_0^r ρ(r') r'^2 dr'
```

### In the inner region (r < R_disk):
Most visible matter (stars, gas) is concentrated in the galactic disk. Here, `M(r) ∝ r`, so:

```latex
v(r) ∝ \sqrt{r} \quad \text{(rising)}
```

### In the outer region (r > R_disk):
Beyond the visible disk, if only luminous matter exists, `M(r)` becomes approximately constant, giving:

```latex
v(r) ∝ \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}} \quad \text{(Keplerian decline)}
```

**Expected behavior:** Velocity rises in the inner regions, then **declines** in outer regions.

## Step 2: Observed Rotation Curves

### What observations show:
- Velocities **rise** in inner regions (as expected)
- Velocities remain **flat** or slightly rising in outer regions, extending far beyond the visible disk
- This flat behavior persists to large radii (often `r > 10 R_disk`)

### Mathematical implication:
For `v(r) ≈ v_0 = \text{constant}`:

```latex
v_0 = \sqrt{\frac{GM(r)}{r}} \implies M(r) ∝ r
```

This requires the mass to increase linearly with radius, even where **no visible matter exists**.

## Step 3: Dark Matter Distribution

### The Dark Matter Halo

To explain flat rotation curves, galaxies must be embedded in extended **dark matter halos** with density profile:

```latex
ρ_{DM}(r) ∝ \frac{1}{r^2} \quad \text{(for } M(r) ∝ r\text{)}
```

### Common density profiles:

**NFW Profile** (Navarro-Frenk-White):
```latex
ρ(r) = \frac{ρ_0}{(r/r_s)(1 + r/r_s)^2}
```

**Isothermal Sphere**:
```latex
ρ(r) = \frac{v_0^2}{4πGr^2}
```

where `r_s` is a scale radius and `ρ_0` is a characteristic density.

## Step 4: Amount of Dark Matter

### Observational findings:

**Mass ratio:** In typical spiral galaxies:
```latex
\frac{M_{DM}}{M_{visible}} ≈ 5-10 \quad \text{(within virial radius)}
```

**Specific example (Milky Way):**
- Visible matter: `M_{visible} ≈ 6 × 10^{10} M_☉`
- Dark matter halo: `M_{DM} ≈ 10^{12} M_☉`
- Ratio: `M_{DM}/M_{visible} ≈ 17`

### Surface density:
The required dark matter surface density at radius `r` is:

```latex
Σ_{DM}(r) = \frac{v_0^2}{2πGr}
```

## Step 5: Spatial Distribution

### Key characteristics of dark matter placement:

1. **Spherical/ellipsoidal halo:** Unlike the disk-like distribution of visible matter, dark matter forms a roughly spherical halo

2. **Extended distribution:** The halo extends to `r ≈ 200-300` kpc, much larger than the visible disk (`R_{disk} ≈ 15` kpc for the Milky Way)

3. **Core vs. Cusp debate:**
   - Simulations predict **cusped** profiles: `ρ(r) ∝ r^{-1}` as `r → 0`
   - Some observations suggest **cored** profiles: `ρ(r) → \text{constant}` as `r → 0`

4. **Dominance regions:**
   - Inner galaxy (`r < 10` kpc): Visible matter dominates
   - Outer regions (`r > 20` kpc): Dark matter dominates

## Summary: What Observations Tell Us

### Amount:
- Dark matter constitutes **~85%** of total galactic mass
- Dark matter to visible matter ratio: **5:1 to 10:1** in typical galaxies
- Total dark matter mass: **~10¹²** solar masses for Milky Way-sized galaxies

### Placement:
- **Spherical halo** extending 10-20 times beyond visible disk
- **Relatively smooth** distribution (not clumpy like stars)
- **Density decreases** with radius approximately as `ρ ∝ r^{-2}`
- **Dynamically dominant** in outer regions

### Final Answer:
Dark matter creates flat rotation curves by providing a mass distribution `M(r) ∝ r` in outer regions. Observations require that galaxies are embedded in massive, extended dark matter halos containing 5-10 times more mass than visible matter, distributed spherically with decreasing density (`ρ ∝ r^{-2}`) and extending far beyond the luminous disk. This represents one of the most compelling pieces of evidence for dark matter's existence.

Of course. Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step solution to the question regarding dark matter and galaxy rotation curves.

### Introduction

The rotation curve of a galaxy is a plot of the orbital velocity of its visible stars and gas as a function of their distance from the galactic center. This tool is fundamental to astrophysics because it allows us to map the distribution of mass within a galaxy. The discrepancy between the rotation curves predicted by the visible, luminous matter in galaxies and the curves that are actually observed is one of the most robust pieces of evidence for the existence of **dark matter**.

---

### Part 1: The Expected Rotation Curve from Visible Matter

Let's begin by deriving what we *expect* to see based on the laws of gravity and the distribution of visible matter (stars, gas, and dust).

#### **Fundamental Principle**

For a star or gas cloud in a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force pulling it toward the center of the galaxy must be equal to the centripetal force required to keep it in its orbit.

1.  **Gravitational Force:** According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, the force on an object of mass `m` is:
    $F_g = \frac{G M(r) m}{r^2}$
    where `G` is the gravitational constant, `r` is the distance from the center, and $M(r)$ is the **total mass enclosed within the radius** `r`.

2.  **Centripetal Force:** The force required to maintain a circular orbit is:
    $F_c = \frac{m v^2}{r}$
    where `v` is the orbital velocity of the object.

#### **Deriving the Velocity Profile**

By equating these two forces, we can solve for the orbital velocity `v`:

$\frac{G M(r) m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}$

$v(r) = \sqrt{\frac{G M(r)}{r}}$

This crucial equation tells us that the orbital velocity at any radius `r` depends on the total mass *enclosed* within that radius. To predict the rotation curve, we need to understand how $M(r)$ changes as `r` increases, based on the distribution of visible matter.

#### **Analyzing the Visible Mass Distribution**

We can divide a typical spiral galaxy into two main regions based on its visible matter:

1.  **Inside the Luminous Disk/Bulge:** Near the center of the galaxy, most of the mass is concentrated. As we move outward from the center, the enclosed mass $M(r)$ increases rapidly. If we approximate the central bulge as a sphere of constant density, then $M(r) \propto r^3$.
    *   In this region, the velocity would be: $v(r) \propto \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{r}} = \sqrt{r^2} = r$.
    *   **Prediction:** The velocity should increase linearly with distance from the center.

2.  **Outside the Luminous Disk:** At large distances from the center, we are outside most of the galaxy's stars and gas. Here, the enclosed visible mass $M(r)$ becomes roughly constant, equal to the total visible mass of the galaxy, $M_{total}$.
    *   In this region, the velocity should follow Kepler's Laws: $v(r) \approx \sqrt{\frac{G M_{total}}{r}}$
    *   **Prediction:** The velocity should decrease with distance, proportional to $1/\sqrt{r}$. This is known as a **Keplerian decline**.

**Expected Curve Summary:** Based on the visible matter, the rotation curve should rise from the center, reach a peak, and then fall off at large distances.

### Part 2: The Observed Rotation Curve and the Dark Matter Hypothesis

In the 1970s, astronomers like Vera Rubin and Kent Ford made precise measurements of galaxy rotation curves using the Doppler shifts of spectral lines from hydrogen gas clouds, which extend much farther out than the visible stars.

#### **The Observation**

The results were astonishing and completely contradicted the theoretical predictions. Instead of decreasing at large radii, the rotation curves were observed to be **flat**. The orbital velocities of gas clouds remained constant or even slightly increased as far out as they could be measured.

$v(r) \approx \text{constant for large } r$

This discrepancy is known as the **"galaxy rotation problem."** The observed high velocities at large radii imply that there is a significant amount of "missing mass" providing the extra gravitational pull needed to keep the stars and gas in their orbits.

#### **How Dark Matter Solves the Problem**

The leading hypothesis to explain this discrepancy is the existence of **dark matter**—a type of matter that does not emit, absorb, or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, and thus cannot be seen directly. It interacts with normal matter primarily through gravity.

Now, let's answer the first part of your question: **How does the distribution of dark matter affect the rotation curve?**

We use our velocity equation in reverse. If we observe that $v(r)$ is constant ($v_{flat}$) at large `r`, what does that imply about the mass distribution $M(r)$?

$v_{flat} = \sqrt{\frac{G M(r)}{r}}$

$v_{flat}^2 = \frac{G M(r)}{r}$

Solving for the enclosed mass $M(r)$:

$M(r) = \frac{v_{flat}^2 r}{G}$

This result is profound. For the velocity to be constant, the total mass enclosed within a radius `r` must **increase linearly with** `r` ($M(r) \propto r$).

Since the visible mass is not increasing at these distances, this linearly increasing mass must be provided by a new, unseen component: a massive **dark matter halo**.

To find the density profile $\rho(r)$ of this halo, we can relate the enclosed mass to the density. For a spherical distribution, $dM = \rho(r) \cdot 4\pi r^2 dr$.
We require $M(r) \propto r$, which means $\frac{dM}{dr}$ must be a constant.

$\frac{dM}{dr} = \rho(r) 4\pi r^2 = \text{constant}$

Solving for the density profile $\rho(r)$:

$\rho(r) \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$

**Conclusion on Distribution:** A flat rotation curve implies that the galaxy is embedded in a vast, roughly spherical halo of dark matter whose density falls off as $1/r^2$. This halo is much more extended than the visible part of the galaxy.

---

### Part 3: What Observations Tell Us About the Amount and Placement of Dark Matter

The flat rotation curves not only suggest the existence of dark matter but also allow us to quantify its properties.

#### **Placement of Dark Matter**

1.  **Extended Halo:** The fact that the rotation curves remain flat to the furthest measurable distances indicates that the dark matter halo extends far beyond the visible stellar disk. While visible matter is concentrated in the central few kiloparsecs, the dark matter halo can extend for hundreds of kiloparsecs.

2.  **Dominance at Large Radii:** In the inner regions of a galaxy, the gravitational potential is dominated by visible (baryonic) matter. However, as one moves outward, the contribution from the declining visible matter becomes negligible, and the gravitational field becomes completely dominated by the dark matter halo.

3.  **Spherical Shape:** While not perfectly constrained by rotation curves alone (which primarily measure mass in the galactic plane), other evidence from gravitational lensing and simulations suggests these halos are roughly spherical or triaxial ellipsoids.

#### **Amount of Dark Matter**

We can calculate the amount of dark matter required by comparing the observed total mass to the calculated visible mass.

1.  **Total Mass Calculation:** From the observed velocity $v_{obs}$ at a large radius `r`, the total enclosed mass is $M_{total}(r) = \frac{v_{obs}^2 r}{G}$.

2.  **Visible Mass Calculation:** The mass of stars is estimated from the galaxy's luminosity and its mass-to-light ratio, and the mass of gas is measured from radio observations (e.g., the 21-cm hydrogen line). This gives $M_{visible}(r)$.

3.  **Dark Matter Mass:** The mass of the dark matter is simply the difference:
    $M_{dark}(r) = M_{total}(r) - M_{visible}(r)$

The results of these calculations are definitive:

*   **Vast Majority of Mass:** For a typical spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, the amount of dark matter is found to be **5 to 10 times** the amount of visible matter.
*   **Cosmic Abundance:** These galactic-scale observations are consistent with cosmological measurements (like the Cosmic Microwave Background), which indicate that dark matter constitutes about **85% of the total matter** in the universe, and about 27% of its total energy density. Luminous matter makes up only about 5% of the universe's energy density.

### Final Answer

The distribution of dark matter fundamentally alters the rotation curve of a galaxy from what would be expected based on its visible matter.

1.  **How it Affects the Curve:** The presence of a massive, extended dark matter halo provides the extra gravitational force needed to keep stars and gas in high-velocity orbits at large distances from the galactic center. This prevents the expected Keplerian decline ($v \propto 1/\sqrt{r}$) and instead produces the observed **flat rotation curve** ($v \approx \text{constant}$). This flatness implies that the dark matter is distributed in a halo with a density profile that decreases approximately as $\rho(r) \propto 1/r^2$.

2.  **What Observations Tell Us:** Observations of galaxy rotation curves reveal that:
    *   **Placement:** Dark matter is not concentrated in the luminous disk but forms a vast, roughly spherical halo that extends far beyond the visible edge of the galaxy. It dominates the mass of the galaxy at all but the very central regions.
    *   **Amount:** The discrepancy between the observed velocity and the velocity predicted by visible matter indicates that dark matter is the dominant mass component of galaxies. It accounts for approximately **90% of the total mass of a typical galaxy**, and about 85% of the matter content of the universe as a whole.

### openai/gpt-5
Below is a concise, step-by-step explanation of how the mass distribution determines a galaxy’s rotation curve and what observations imply about the amount and spatial distribution of dark matter (DM) in galaxies.

1) Dynamical basics

- For a test particle on a circular orbit at radius r in a (nearly) spherical potential,
  V_c^2(r) = r ∂Φ/∂r = GM(r)/r,
  where M(r) is the total mass enclosed within r.

- For a general axisymmetric galaxy, one often writes the observed circular speed as a quadrature of components,
  V_c^2(r) = V_{\mathrm{bulge}}^2(r) + V_{\mathrm{disk}}^2(r) + V_{\mathrm{gas}}^2(r) + V_{\mathrm{halo}}^2(r),
  and fits the rotation curve to infer the mass of each component.

- Exponential stellar disks (surface density Σ(R) = Σ_0 e^{-R/R_d}) have a rotation curve that rises to a maximum near R ≈ 2.2 R_d and then declines roughly as R^{-1/2} at large radii if there is no additional mass.

2) What a flat rotation curve implies for the mass profile

- If the observed rotation curve is flat at large radii, V_c(r) ≈ V_0 (constant), then
  M(r) = V_0^2 r / G,
  i.e., mass continues to grow linearly with radius rather than asymptoting to a constant.

- The corresponding spherically-averaged density profile is
  ρ(r) = (1/4πr^2) dM/dr = V_0^2 / (4π G r^2).
  Thus, a flat rotation curve implies ρ(r) ∝ r^{-2} over the radii where the curve is flat (the “isothermal” behavior).

- Numerical example: for V_0 = 200 km s^{-1} at r = 10 kpc,
  ρ ≈ V_0^2 / (4π G r^2) ≈ 7 × 10^{-3} M_⊙ pc^{-3},
  comparable to the dark matter density inferred near the Sun.

3) Common halo profiles and their rotation curves

- Cored isothermal-like halo:
  ρ(r) = ρ_0 r_c^2 / (r^2 + r_c^2),
  which gives V_c(r) rising in the inner parts and approaching a constant V_∞ for r ≫ r_c. This reproduces flat outer rotation curves and has a central “core” (finite density as r → 0).

- NFW profile (ΛCDM simulations):
  ρ(r) = ρ_s / [(r/r_s)(1 + r/r_s)^2],
  whose enclosed mass is
  M(r) = 4π ρ_s r_s^3 [ln(1 + x) − x/(1 + x)], with x = r/r_s,
  and V_c^2(r) = G M(r) / r.
  The inner slope is “cuspy” (ρ ∝ r^{-1}) and the outer slope is ρ ∝ r^{-3}. The rotation curve typically rises to a broad maximum and then slowly declines, but after adding the baryonic disk and bulge the total can be very flat over a wide range.

- In practice, the observed V_c(r) is fit by the sum of a disk+bulge+gas model and a halo model (isothermal-like or NFW). The degeneracy with the stellar mass-to-light ratio is constrained by stellar population modeling, dynamics, and sometimes by lensing.

4) What observations show

- Flat or slowly rising rotation curves:
  HI and Hα rotation curves of spirals remain flat (or even slightly rising) out to many disk scale lengths (often >5–10 R_d, tens of kpc). Since the stellar disk surface density falls exponentially, the persistence of V_c ≈ const requires an extended dark halo whose mass continues to grow roughly linearly with radius over that range.

- Amount of dark matter as a function of radius and galaxy type:
  - High-surface-brightness L⋆ spirals (e.g., Milky Way):
    • Inner few kpc: baryons (bulge+disk) can dominate.
    • At the Solar circle (r ≈ 8 kpc), the dark matter fraction is often ∼30–60%, with a local dark matter density ρ_DM,⊙ ≈ 0.008–0.015 M_⊙ pc^{-3} (≈0.3–0.6 GeV cm^{-3}).
    • Total halo mass M_{200} ~ (0.7–2) × 10^{12} M_⊙ with virial radius ~200–300 kpc; the dark matter fraction within the virial radius is ≳80%.
  - Low-surface-brightness spirals and dwarf irregulars:
    • Rotation curves rise more slowly and remain DM-dominated at essentially all radii.
    • Inferred inner density profiles are often “cored” (approximately constant-density centers), creating the core–cusp tension with pure NFW cusps.
  - Dwarf spheroidals (pressure-supported):
    • Stellar kinematics imply high mass-to-light ratios, with M(<300 pc) ~ 10^7 M_⊙ typical—very DM dominated.

- Spatial distribution (“placement”) of the dark matter:
  - The halo is much more extended than the luminous disk, roughly spherical or mildly flattened, with scale radii r_s of order 10–30 kpc for L⋆ halos and virial extents of hundreds of kpc.
  - Within the optical disk, DM contribution increases with radius; beyond a few disk scale lengths, the halo dominates the rotation curve.
  - Halo concentration and mass follow the ΛCDM concentration–mass relation; typical concentrations c ≡ r_{200}/r_s ~ 5–15 for galaxy halos.
  - In many dwarfs, data favor central cores of size ≳ a kiloparsec; in more massive spirals, halo profiles are broadly consistent with NFW once baryonic effects (e.g., adiabatic contraction/expansion and feedback) and observational systematics are accounted for.
  - Gravitational lensing (strong/weak) and satellite kinematics independently confirm extended, massive halos around galaxies and measure halo masses and concentrations out to ≳100 kpc.

- Global empirical relations:
  - Baryonic Tully–Fisher relation: M_b ∝ V_f^4, where V_f is the flat part of the rotation curve; this tight relation links the amplitude of V_c to the total baryonic mass, reflecting a coupling between baryons and the halo potential.
  - Mass discrepancy–acceleration relation: the ratio V_c^2/V_b^2 correlates with the baryonic acceleration g_b, encoding where DM must dominate (low-acceleration, outer regions and LSB/dwarfs).

5) Putting it together: How distribution shapes V_c(r)

- Luminous (exponential) disks alone predict V_c that peaks near 2.2 R_d and declines, V_c ∝ r^{-1/2}, at large radii.
- The observed flatness requires additional mass at large r: M(r) ∝ r and hence ρ(r) ∝ r^{-2} over the range where V_c is flat.
- A cored isothermal halo reproduces flat curves naturally; an NFW halo plus baryons can also yield flat total V_c over wide radii, with detailed shape depending on halo mass and concentration and on the disk’s mass-to-light ratio.

Final answer

- The circular speed is set by the enclosed mass: V_c^2(r) = GM(r)/r. Exponential stellar disks cannot maintain V_c ≈ const at large r; they predict a declining V_c once most stellar mass is enclosed. The observed flat rotation curves require an extended dark halo such that M(r) ∝ r and ρ(r) ≈ V_0^2/(4π G r^2) over the region where V_c is flat.

- Fits to rotation curves, together with lensing and satellite dynamics, imply that:
  • Spiral galaxies reside in massive, extended, roughly spherical halos with virial masses ~10^{11}–10^{12.5} M_⊙ and radii of hundreds of kpc; dark matter provides ≳80% of the mass within the virial radius and dominates the rotation curve beyond a few disk scale lengths.
  • In L⋆ spirals, baryons can dominate the inner few kpc while the DM fraction grows with radius; near the Sun the DM density is ~0.01 M_⊙ pc^{-3}. Dwarfs are DM-dominated at essentially all radii.
  • The shape of V_c(r) favors an approximate ρ ∝ r^{-2} over large radial ranges; low-mass/low-surface-brightness systems often prefer cored centers, while higher-mass spirals are broadly consistent with NFW-like halos once baryonic effects are included.

Thus, the distribution of dark matter—extended and slowly declining in density—sets the flatness and amplitude of galaxy rotation curves, and observations tightly constrain both the amount (dominant at large radii, large total halo masses) and the placement (extended halos with inner profiles ranging from cuspy to cored depending on galaxy type and baryonic physics).
