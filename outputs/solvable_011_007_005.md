## Question
What is the refractive index of a semiconductor material with a given wavelength of light, assuming a known electronic band structure and dielectric constant? Use the appropriate equations and principles of solid state physics to calculate the refractive index and interpret the results in terms of the material's optical properties.

## True Answer
To calculate the refractive index of a semiconductor material, we need to consider its electronic band structure and dielectric constant. The refractive index (n) can be related to the dielectric constant (ε) using the following equation:

n = √ε

The dielectric constant (ε) can be expressed in terms of the real (ε₁) and imaginary (ε₂) parts:

ε = ε₁ - iε₂

The real part (ε₁) is related to the refractive index (n), while the imaginary part (ε₂) is related to the absorption coefficient (k) of the material:

n = √[(ε₁ + √(ε₁² + ε₂²))/2]
k = √[(√(ε₁² + ε₂²) - ε₁)/2]

To find the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, we need to consider the electronic band structure of the semiconductor material. The joint density of states (JDOS) and the absorption spectrum can be calculated using the band structure. The imaginary part of the dielectric constant (ε₂) can be calculated using the following equation:

ε₂(ω) = (2/π) * (ω * e² / (2 * ε₀ * c)) * ∫(JDOS(E) * f(E) * dE)

where ω is the angular frequency of light, e is the electron charge, ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, c is the speed of light, and f(E) is the absorption spectrum.

The real part of the dielectric constant (ε₁) can be calculated using the Kramers-Kronig relation:

ε₁(ω) = 1 + (2/π) * P ∫[(ω' * ε₂(ω')) / (ω'^2 - ω²) * dω']

where P denotes the principal value of the integral.

Once we have the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, we can calculate the refractive index (n) and the absorption coefficient (k) using the equations mentioned earlier. The refractive index provides information about the material's ability to bend light, while the absorption coefficient indicates how much light is absorbed by the material.

In summary, to calculate the refractive index of a semiconductor material with a given wavelength of light, we need to consider its electronic band structure and dielectric constant. By calculating the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant using the band structure, JDOS, and absorption spectrum, we can determine the refractive index and interpret the material's optical properties.

# Refractive Index of a Semiconductor Material

I'll provide a comprehensive solution for calculating the refractive index of a semiconductor using solid-state physics principles.

## 1. Fundamental Relationship

The refractive index `n` is related to the dielectric constant through:

```latex
n(\omega) = \sqrt{\varepsilon_r(\omega)}
```

where `\varepsilon_r(\omega)` is the relative complex dielectric function at frequency `\omega`.

## 2. Complex Dielectric Function

The complex dielectric function is:

```latex
\varepsilon_r(\omega) = \varepsilon_1(\omega) + i\varepsilon_2(\omega)
```

This gives a complex refractive index:

```latex
\tilde{n}(\omega) = n(\omega) + i\kappa(\omega)
```

where `n` is the refractive index and `\kappa` is the extinction coefficient.

## 3. Key Contributions to the Dielectric Function

### A. High-Frequency Dielectric Constant

The dielectric function includes:

```latex
\varepsilon_r(\omega) = \varepsilon_{\infty} + \varepsilon_{\text{interband}}(\omega) + \varepsilon_{\text{free carrier}}(\omega)
```

where:
- `\varepsilon_{\infty}` = high-frequency dielectric constant (lattice contribution)
- Interband transitions contribute near and above the bandgap
- Free carrier contribution (important for doped semiconductors)

### B. Interband Transitions

For photon energies `ℏω` near the bandgap `E_g`, the imaginary part is:

```latex
\varepsilon_2(\omega) \propto \sum_{v,c} \int \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} |\langle c,\mathbf{k}|p|v,\mathbf{k}\rangle|^2 \delta(E_c(\mathbf{k}) - E_v(\mathbf{k}) - \hbar\omega)
```

where the sum is over valence (v) and conduction (c) bands.

## 4. Practical Calculation Steps

### Step 1: Determine the Photon Energy

```latex
E_{\text{photon}} = \hbar\omega = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
```

### Step 2: Compare with Bandgap

**Case A: Below Bandgap (`ℏω < E_g`)**

For transparent region:
- `\varepsilon_2 \approx 0` (negligible absorption)
- Use the Sellmeier equation or simplified models

```latex
n^2(\lambda) = A + \frac{B\lambda^2}{\lambda^2 - \lambda_0^2}
```

Or use the static dielectric constant:

```latex
n \approx \sqrt{\varepsilon_{\infty}}
```

**Case B: Near/Above Bandgap (`ℏω ≥ E_g`)**

Use the Kramers-Kronig relations to connect `\varepsilon_1` and `\varepsilon_2`:

```latex
\varepsilon_1(\omega) = \varepsilon_{\infty} + \frac{2}{\pi}P\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\omega'\varepsilon_2(\omega')}{\omega'^2 - \omega^2}d\omega'
```

### Step 3: Account for Free Carriers (if doped)

The Drude model contribution:

```latex
\varepsilon_{\text{free}}(\omega) = -\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2 + i\gamma\omega}
```

where the plasma frequency is:

```latex
\omega_p^2 = \frac{ne^2}{\varepsilon_0 m^*}
```

## 5. Specific Example Calculation

Let's calculate for **GaAs** at `\lambda = 1000` nm (infrared):

**Given Parameters:**
- `\varepsilon_{\infty} = 10.9` (high-frequency dielectric constant)
- `E_g = 1.42` eV (bandgap at 300K)
- `\lambda = 1000` nm

**Step 1:** Calculate photon energy

```latex
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1240 \text{ eV·nm}}{1000 \text{ nm}} = 1.24 \text{ eV}
```

**Step 2:** Compare with bandgap

Since `E_photon = 1.24 eV < E_g = 1.42 eV`, we're in the transparent region.

**Step 3:** Calculate refractive index

```latex
n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_{\infty}} = \sqrt{10.9} \approx 3.30
```

For more accuracy, using the empirical Sellmeier relation for GaAs:

```latex
n^2 = 5.372 + \frac{4.7\lambda^2}{\lambda^2 - 0.3282^2}
```

At `\lambda = 1.0` μm:

```latex
n \approx 3.37
```

## 6. Physical Interpretation

### Optical Properties Analysis:

1. **High Refractive Index:** The value `n ≈ 3.37` is typical for III-V semiconductors, indicating strong polarizability of the electron cloud.

2. **Dispersion:** `n` decreases with increasing wavelength in the transparent region (normal dispersion).

3. **Transparency Window:** Below bandgap, `\kappa \approx 0`, making the material transparent.

4. **Critical Points:** Near `E_g`, strong absorption occurs (`\varepsilon_2` peaks), and `n` shows anomalous dispersion.

5. **Applications:** High `n` enables:
   - Efficient light confinement in waveguides
   - High reflectivity at interfaces
   - Photonic device applications

## 7. Final Summary

**The refractive index calculation requires:**

```latex
n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_r} = \sqrt{\varepsilon_{\infty} + \Delta\varepsilon(\omega)}
```

where `\Delta\varepsilon(\omega)` includes interband and free carrier contributions based on the electronic band structure and wavelength relative to the bandgap energy.

## The Refractive Index of a Semiconductor

### Abstract

The refractive index of a semiconductor is a frequency-dependent property fundamentally dictated by how photons interact with the electrons in the material's band structure. The key parameter is the semiconductor's band gap energy, $E_g$, which separates the occupied valence band from the empty conduction band. We will analyze two distinct regimes: when the photon energy is below the band gap (transparency) and when it is above the band gap (absorption).

### 1. Fundamental Principles and Equations

The optical properties of any material are described by its complex dielectric function, $\tilde{\epsilon}(\omega)$, and its complex refractive index, $\tilde{n}(\omega)$. The relationship between them is central to this problem.

1.  **Complex Refractive Index ($\tilde{n}$):** This describes the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a medium.
    $ \tilde{n} = n + i\kappa $
    *   $n$: The real part, known as the **refractive index**, determines the phase velocity of light in the material ($v = c/n$).
    *   $\kappa$: The imaginary part, known as the **extinction coefficient**, quantifies the attenuation or absorption of light as it passes through the material.

2.  **Complex Dielectric Function ($\tilde{\epsilon}$):** This describes the material's response (polarization) to an applied electric field.
    $ \tilde{\epsilon} = \epsilon_1 + i\epsilon_2 $
    *   $\epsilon_1$: The real part is related to the polarization and the stored energy in the material.
    *   $\epsilon_2$: The imaginary part is related to dielectric loss and energy dissipation, which corresponds to optical absorption.

3.  **Fundamental Connection:** For a non-magnetic material ($\mu_r \approx 1$), Maxwell's equations yield the following relationship:
    $ \tilde{n}^2 = \tilde{\epsilon}_r = \frac{\tilde{\epsilon}}{\epsilon_0} $
    where $\tilde{\epsilon}_r$ is the relative complex permittivity (often just written as $\tilde{\epsilon}$).

    Expanding this equation gives:
    $ (n + i\kappa)^2 = n^2 - \kappa^2 + 2in\kappa = \epsilon_1 + i\epsilon_2 $

    By equating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain two key equations:
    $ n^2 - \kappa^2 = \epsilon_1 $
    $ 2n\kappa = \epsilon_2 $

    Solving this system for $n$ and $\kappa$ yields the general formulas:
    $ n^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \epsilon_1 + \sqrt{\epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2} \right) $
    $ \kappa^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( -\epsilon_1 + \sqrt{\epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2} \right) $

    The task now is to determine $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ based on the material's properties and the incident light.

### 2. Analysis Based on Band Structure

The crucial step is to relate the dielectric function to the electronic band structure of the semiconductor. The energy of the incident photons, $E_{\text{ph}}$, is compared to the semiconductor's band gap, $E_g$.

The photon energy is given by:
$ E_{\text{ph}} = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $
where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light.

---

### Case 1: Below the Band Gap ($E_{\text{ph}} < E_g$)

#### **Physical Interpretation:**
When the photon energy is less than the band gap energy, the photons do not have sufficient energy to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Therefore, direct **interband absorption** cannot occur. The material is essentially transparent to these photons.

In this regime, the absorption is negligible. This implies:
*   The imaginary part of the dielectric function is approximately zero: $\epsilon_2 \approx 0$.
*   Consequently, the extinction coefficient is also approximately zero: $\kappa \approx 0$.

#### **Calculation:**
With $\epsilon_2 \approx 0$, our general formulas simplify significantly.
From $2n\kappa = \epsilon_2$, we get $\kappa = 0$.
From $n^2 - \kappa^2 = \epsilon_1$, we get $n^2 = \epsilon_1$.

So, for $E_{\text{ph}} < E_g$:
$ n \approx \sqrt{\epsilon_1} $

At these low frequencies (relative to the band gap), the real part of the dielectric function, $\epsilon_1$, is well-approximated by the material's **static (or low-frequency) dielectric constant**, denoted as $\epsilon_r$ or $\epsilon_{\text{static}}$. This value represents the material's ability to be polarized by a static electric field.

#### **Example Calculation:**
Let's calculate the refractive index of **Silicon (Si)** for infrared light used in telecommunications.

*   **Given:**
    *   Wavelength, $\lambda = 1550 \, \text{nm} = 1.55 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}$
    *   Band gap of Si, $E_g \approx 1.12 \, \text{eV}$
    *   Static dielectric constant of Si, $\epsilon_r \approx 11.7$

*   **Step 1: Calculate the photon energy.**
    We use $hc \approx 1240 \, \text{eV}\cdot\text{nm}$.
    $ E_{\text{ph}} = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV}\cdot\text{nm}}{1550 \, \text{nm}} \approx 0.80 \, \text{eV} $

*   **Step 2: Compare photon energy with the band gap.**
    $ E_{\text{ph}} (0.80 \, \text{eV}) < E_g (1.12 \, \text{eV}) $
    We are in the "below the band gap" regime.

*   **Step 3: Calculate the refractive index.**
    Using the simplified formula for this case:
    $ n \approx \sqrt{\epsilon_r} $
    $ n \approx \sqrt{11.7} \approx 3.42 $

*   **Final Answer (Case 1):** The refractive index of Silicon at a wavelength of 1550 nm is approximately **3.42**.

---

### Case 2: Above the Band Gap ($E_{\text{ph}} > E_g$)

#### **Physical Interpretation:**
When the photon energy is greater than the band gap, a photon can be absorbed, exciting an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. This process, called **interband absorption**, creates an electron-hole pair. The material is therefore opaque to these photons.

In this regime, absorption is significant. This implies:
*   The imaginary part of the dielectric function is non-zero: $\epsilon_2 > 0$.
*   The extinction coefficient is also non-zero: $\kappa > 0$.

#### **Calculation:**
Here, we must use the full, general expressions for $n$ and $\kappa$. The challenge is that $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ are strongly frequency-dependent. Simple models for a direct band gap semiconductor predict:
$ \epsilon_2(\omega) \propto \frac{\sqrt{\hbar\omega - E_g}}{(\hbar\omega)^2} \quad \text{for} \quad \hbar\omega > E_g $
$ \epsilon_1(\omega) $ can then be determined from $\epsilon_2(\omega)$ via the **Kramers-Kronig relations**, which mathematically connect the real and imaginary parts of any causal response function.

For a practical calculation, one would typically use experimentally measured values or sophisticated theoretical models for $\epsilon_1(\omega)$ and $\epsilon_2(\omega)$ at the desired frequency.

#### **Example Calculation:**
Let's estimate the refractive index of **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** for red light.

*   **Given:**
    *   Wavelength, $\lambda = 620 \, \text{nm} = 6.2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}$
    *   Band gap of GaAs, $E_g \approx 1.42 \, \text{eV}$
    *   At this wavelength, experimental data for GaAs provide approximate values for the dielectric function: $\epsilon_1 \approx 15.0$ and $\epsilon_2 \approx 3.5$.

*   **Step 1: Calculate the photon energy.**
    $ E_{\text{ph}} = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV}\cdot\text{nm}}{620 \, \text{nm}} = 2.0 \, \text{eV} $

*   **Step 2: Compare photon energy with the band gap.**
    $ E_{\text{ph}} (2.0 \, \text{eV}) > E_g (1.42 \, \text{eV}) $
    We are in the "above the band gap" regime.

*   **Step 3: Calculate the refractive index ($n$) and extinction coefficient ($\kappa$).**
    We use the general formulas:
    $ n^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \epsilon_1 + \sqrt{\epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2} \right) $
    $ n^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 15.0 + \sqrt{(15.0)^2 + (3.5)^2} \right) $
    $ n^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 15.0 + \sqrt{225 + 12.25} \right) $
    $ n^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 15.0 + \sqrt{237.25} \right) \approx \frac{1}{2} \left( 15.0 + 15.40 \right) = 15.20 $
    $ n = \sqrt{15.20} \approx 3.90 $

    $ \kappa^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( -\epsilon_1 + \sqrt{\epsilon_1^2 + \epsilon_2^2} \right) $
    $ \kappa^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( -15.0 + 15.40 \right) = 0.20 $
    $ \kappa = \sqrt{0.20} \approx 0.45 $

*   **Final Answer (Case 2):** The complex refractive index of Gallium Arsenide at 620 nm is approximately **$\tilde{n} \approx 3.90 + i(0.45)$**. The refractive index is $n \approx 3.90$.

### Interpretation and Optical Properties

The results from our two cases reveal the dual nature of a semiconductor's optical properties:

1.  **Transparency in the Infrared ($E_{\text{ph}} < E_g$):**
    *   Our calculation for Si showed $n \approx 3.42$ and $\kappa \approx 0$.
    *   **Interpretation:** Silicon is transparent to infrared light. The high refractive index means light slows down considerably inside Si, and there is a high reflectivity at the Si-air interface (governed by Fresnel's equations). This property makes Si an excellent material for infrared optics, waveguides for silicon photonics, and substrates for IR detectors.

2.  **Opacity and Absorption in the Visible/UV ($E_{\text{ph}} > E_g$):**
    *   Our calculation for GaAs showed $n \approx 3.90$ and a significant $\kappa \approx 0.45$.
    *   **Interpretation:** The non-zero extinction coefficient means that light is strongly absorbed. The **absorption coefficient**, $\alpha$, is related to $\kappa$ by $\alpha = \frac{4\pi\kappa}{\lambda}$.
        $ \alpha = \frac{4\pi(0.45)}{620 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}} \approx 9.1 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1} = 9.1 \times 10^4 \, \text{cm}^{-1} $
    *   This extremely high absorption coefficient means that the light intensity falls to $1/e$ of its initial value in a distance of only $1/\alpha \approx 0.11 \, \mu\text{m}$. This strong absorption is precisely the principle that allows semiconductors like GaAs and Si to be used for **solar cells** and **photodetectors**, where the goal is to efficiently absorb incident photons to generate electrical current. The sharp transition from transparency to strong absorption at the band gap energy is known as the **fundamental absorption edge** and is a defining characteristic of a semiconductor's optical spectrum.

### openai/gpt-5
Goal: Given a wavelength λ and a semiconductor with known electronic band structure and dielectric constant, compute the refractive index and interpret the result.

Key principle:
For a nonmagnetic solid (μr ≈ 1), the complex refractive index ñ(ω) = n(ω) + i κ(ω) is related to the complex dielectric function ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + i ε2(ω) by
ñ(ω)^2 = ε(ω).
Equivalently,
n(ω) = sqrt[(|ε| + ε1)/2],     κ(ω) = sqrt[(|ε| − ε1)/2],     |ε| = √(ε1^2 + ε2^2).

Thus the task reduces to computing ε(ω) from the band structure at photon angular frequency ω = 2πc/λ.

Step 1: Convert wavelength to photon energy/frequency
ω = 2πc/λ,     ℏω = hc/λ.

Step 2: Decompose the dielectric function
At optical frequencies, the electronic dielectric response of a semiconductor can be written as
ε(ω) = ε∞ + εinter(ω) + εintra(ω) + εlat(ω),
where:
- ε∞ is the “background” (high-frequency) electronic dielectric constant from remote bands (often called the electronic contribution).
- εinter(ω) is the interband contribution from valence-to-conduction transitions near ℏω.
- εintra(ω) is the intraband (Drude) contribution if free carriers are present (doped/degenerate material).
- εlat(ω) is the lattice (phonon) contribution, important only in the infrared near optical phonons; for visible/near-IR above phonon energies, εlat(ω) can usually be neglected.

If the photon energy lies well below the first strong interband transition (ℏω < Eg and far from excitonic resonances) and free-carrier density is negligible, then ε(ω) ≈ ε∞ and n(λ) ≈ √ε∞.

Step 3: Interband dielectric function from the band structure (independent-particle/RPA)
Given E_n(k) and the dipole (or velocity/momentum) matrix elements between Bloch states, the absorptive part ε2(ω) in the length gauge is
ε2(ω) = (8π^2 e^2/Ω) ∑_{v,c} ∫_{BZ} (d^3k/(2π)^3) |⟨c,k| ê · r |v,k⟩|^2 δ(E_c(k) − E_v(k) − ℏω),
where:
- v and c denote occupied valence and empty conduction bands,
- ê is the light polarization unit vector,
- Ω is the crystal volume used to normalize Bloch states,
- the integral is over the Brillouin zone.
Equivalently, in the velocity (or momentum) gauge one can write
ε2(ω) = (2π e^2/(ε0 ω^2)) ∑_{v,c} ∫_{BZ} (d^3k/(2π)^3) |ê · v_cv(k)|^2 δ(E_c − E_v − ℏω),
with v the velocity operator matrix element; or using momentum p, replace v by p/m0.

Given ε2(ω), obtain the dispersive part ε1(ω) by the Kramers–Kronig relation
ε1(ω) = 1 + (2/π) P ∫_0^∞ dξ (ξ ε2(ξ))/(ξ^2 − ω^2),
where P denotes principal value.

Special near-edge model (direct allowed gap, parabolic bands):
If E_c,v(k) ≈ E_c,v(0) + ℏ^2 k^2/(2 m_c,v) and the momentum matrix element P_cv is slowly varying, the 3D joint density of states gives
ε2(ω) ∝ (|P_cv|^2/ω^2) √(ℏω − Eg) Θ(ℏω − Eg),
and Kramers–Kronig then produces a strong increase of ε1(ω) below Eg (anomalous dispersion). This explains large n just below the absorption edge.

Step 4: Intraband (Drude) term if free carriers are present
For electron (or hole) density n_fc with effective mass m*, damping γ:
εintra(ω) = − ω_p^2/(ω^2 + i γ ω),     ω_p^2 = n_fc e^2/(ε0 m*).
Drude carriers reduce ε1 and add ε2 > 0 at low ω, producing absorption (κ > 0) and a plasma edge when ε1 crosses zero.

Step 5: Compute the refractive index
- Form ε(ω) = ε∞ + εinter(ω) + εintra(ω) (+ εlat if in the Reststrahlen region).
- Compute
|ε| = √(ε1^2 + ε2^2),
n(ω) = √[(|ε| + ε1)/2],   κ(ω) = √[(|ε| − ε1)/2].
- Absorption coefficient:
α(ω) = 2 ω κ(ω)/c.

Two practically important limits

A) Transparent region below the band gap (no free carriers, ℏω ≪ Eg):
ε2(ω) ≈ 0, ε1(ω) ≈ ε∞, so
n(λ) ≈ √ε∞.
Small dispersion can be included with a Lorentz/Sellmeier form from remote oscillators:
ε1(ω) = 1 + ∑_j f_j ω_j^2/(ω_j^2 − ω^2),   so that   n^2(λ) = 1 + ∑_j A_j λ^2/(λ^2 − λ_j^2).

B) Near and above the direct gap:
Use the Kubo–Greenwood expression (Step 3) on the given E_n(k) and dipole matrix elements to compute ε2, then use Kramers–Kronig for ε1, then extract n and κ. For a direct allowed transition with parabolic bands,
ε2(ω) ∝ √(ℏω − Eg)/ω^2,
κ rises from zero at Eg, and n shows strong anomalous dispersion just below Eg.

Optional quick estimate from a “known dielectric constant”
- If the provided dielectric constant is explicitly the high-frequency electronic value ε∞ at your wavelength (i.e., you are in the transparent region), then
n(λ) = √ε∞.
- If the given value is the static dielectric constant ε(0) of a polar semiconductor, but your λ is in the mid/far-IR, include the lattice term via Lyddane–Sachs–Teller:
ε(0)/ε∞ = (ωLO/ωTO)^2,
and use a Lorentz oscillator for the phonon to get ε(ω) and then n(ω).

Worked example (transparent regime)
Suppose ℏω < Eg and the electronic high-frequency dielectric constant is ε∞ = 11.6 (typical of Si/GaAs range). Then
n(λ) ≈ √ε∞ = √11.6 ≈ 3.41,
κ(λ) ≈ 0, α ≈ 0.
If there are free carriers, say n_fc = 1×10^18 cm^−3 and m* = 0.26 m0 at λ = 1.55 μm (ω ≈ 1.22×10^15 s^−1) with γ ≪ ω,
ω_p = √(n_fc e^2/(ε0 m*)) ≈ 3.5×10^13 s^−1,
εintra(ω) ≈ −(ω_p/ω)^2 ≈ −8.2×10^−4,
so n reduces slightly:
n ≈ √(ε∞ + Re εintra) ≈ √(11.5992) ≈ 3.406,
and a small κ ≈ (ω_p^2 γ)/(2 ω^3 n) appears if γ ≠ 0.

Physical interpretation
- The refractive index is set by the electronic polarizability: larger ε∞ (due to dense, easily polarized valence electrons and small band gaps) yields larger n.
- Strong interband transitions near Eg produce large dispersion of n(λ) below the band edge via Kramers–Kronig; this is why narrow-gap semiconductors have very high n in the near-IR.
- Free carriers decrease ε1 and introduce absorption (κ > 0), shifting the plasma edge and reducing n at long wavelengths.
- In polar semiconductors, optical phonons dominate ε(ω) in the far-IR (Reststrahlen band), strongly affecting n and κ; at visible/near-IR, phonons are negligible and the response is electronic.

Final answer recipe
Given λ and the band structure:
1) Compute ω = 2πc/λ.
2) Evaluate ε2(ω) from the band structure using the Kubo–Greenwood/RPA expression (interband) and add any Drude term (intraband).
3) Obtain ε1(ω) via Kramers–Kronig (plus add ε∞).
4) Compute n and κ from ñ^2 = ε(ω).
If ℏω lies well below Eg and free-carrier effects are negligible, you may use the simple and accurate result n(λ) ≈ √ε∞.
